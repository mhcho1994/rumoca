# SPEC_0039: Proof-Carrying Structural Sparsity

## Status
DRAFT

## Summary

Rumoca derives structural sparsity from checked programs and compact domains.
A structural pattern is a sound may-depend relation: entries outside the
pattern are proven zero for every valid execution. Numerical zeros and storage
formats are separate runtime or target choices.

## Specification

### Meaning and Ownership

| Rule | Owner/Where | Brief Justification |
|---|---|---|
| A pattern is a may-depend relation | structural/Solve artifacts | False positives are safe |
| A false negative is a construction defect | all producers | Missing derivatives can corrupt solves |
| Numerical zeros do not change structural patterns | runtime | Values are point-dependent |
| Dense, CSR, CSC, interleaved, and planar are storage policies | runtime/codegen | Layout is not mathematics |
| DAE retains expressions and compact domains, not Jacobian patterns | DAE IR | Sparsity is derived solver metadata |
| Solve artifacts own Jacobian and mass-matrix patterns | phase-solve | Optional solver-facing products |
| Tensor operand patterns stay on checked tensor operations | Solve IR | Kernel semantics need local structure |

`Full` is an explicit conservative pattern, never an implicit default. Every
checked Solve operation has an exhaustive dependency rule. An unavailable
derivative operation fails artifact construction; an unclassified operation is
a compiler error rather than a silently dense or empty dependency.

### Canonical Pattern

A finalized structural pattern has private fields, a checked rectangular
shape, generated provenance, and one canonical representation:

| Representation | Contract |
|---|---|
| `Empty` | No output row depends on an input column |
| `Full` | Every entry may be nonzero |
| `Diagonal` | Only `(i, i)` for the rectangular diagonal may be nonzero |
| `Banded` | Entries are bounded by checked lower/upper bandwidths |
| `Csr` | Row offsets and strictly increasing bounded columns are canonical |
| `Affine` | A compact index domain plus checked row/column affine maps |

CSR uses `u32` indices. Its row-offset count is `rows + 1`, begins at zero,
ends at the column-index count, and is monotone. Columns are in bounds and
strictly increasing within each row. Duplicate and unsorted entries are
rejected. Affine patterns remain O(domain rank + access count); materializing
one entry per domain point in canonical IR is prohibited.

Pattern fields do not derive `Default` or `Deserialize`. Private current-wire
records decode through the same pattern operations. Derived patterns are absent
from canonical Solve wire data and are reconstructed deterministically from
the decoded programs and domains.

### Dependency Derivation

Every initialized register carries one exact may-depend set. Absence from the
register table is a construction error; there is no unknown dependency state.

Fixed tensor-update dependency selection consumes a rank-sized view containing
only whole axes and constant indices. Runtime indices and slices retain the
conservative patch-and-selector rule; a prior Boolean classification cannot
authorize an unreachable dynamic case inside fixed selection.

| Operation | Derived dependency |
|---|---|
| Literal/time/ordinary parameter load | Empty with respect to solver seeds |
| Seed or selected unknown coordinate | Its checked singleton column |
| Move/unary | Operand dependencies |
| Binary/comparison | Union of both operands |
| Select/conditional | Union of condition and every value branch |
| Static array index | Exact selected dependency |
| Bounded dynamic index | Union of the complete selectable run |
| Function call | Checked argument substitution into the function summary |
| Recursive function group | Least monotone fixed point over finite summaries |
| Map/stencil | Compact affine propagation over its owner domain |
| Matrix multiply | Algebraic propagation from both operand patterns |
| Linear solve | All matrix/RHS dependencies unless a proved diagonal or block rule applies |
| Runtime/effect operation | Union of its explicit register operands; the independent effect query records the runtime effect |

Algebraic cancellation does not remove a dependency unless a separately proved
rewrite establishes the identity under the selected numeric semantics.

Numerical AD may omit arithmetic for tangents proved zero by its derivative
rules in the declared seed domain. This proof follows construction, never
sampled zero values, and does not prove the primal value constant: a discrete
operation can have zero tangent while its value changes. Original primal
operations, call owners, assertions, activation, and tensor domains remain
intact. Ordinary parameter independence applies only
to solver-Y differentiation; initialization and parameter sensitivities retain
their parameter seeds. A restricted projection seed domain requires a separate
source-bound artifact and cannot replace a general sensitivity artifact.
Materializing inactive tangents or changing AD lane layout preserves compact
tensor fills, transposes, and concatenations. A transpose may be shared only
for the same immutable register run, shape, and lowering context; tensor extent
must not become a list of scalar copy operations.

### Differentiation, Coloring, and Execution

`SolveArtifacts` may contain structural patterns for continuous, implicit,
manifold, initialization, and requested sensitivity Jacobians. Patterns use
typed row and layout identities during construction; finalized ordinals are
layout only.

Column coloring is derived from a finalized pattern. Construction proves:

- every column occurs in exactly one color;
- columns in one color have disjoint affected-row sets;
- ordering is deterministic.

Compressed AD is selected when the color count is lower than the column count.
Otherwise ordinary AD is used. A backend may choose dense execution for a
sparse pattern, but may not discard or weaken the certificate.

The versioned execution policy compares deterministic operation, storage, and
symbolic-fill estimates. A tie selects dense execution. The first native
consumer is the Diffsol/Faer Model Exchange host; generated and additional
runtime targets consume the same artifact rather than re-deriving sparsity.

### Complex Values

Complex sparsity is first expressed at semantic element-block granularity.
Checked derivative rules expand each complex dependency to a real-lane block.
The conservative expansion is a full 2-by-2 block. Internal block zeros are
removed only by a proved derivative rule. This section is governed jointly
with [SPEC_0035](SPEC_0035_COMPLEX_NUMERIC_TYPES.md).

### Correct Construction and Evidence

Raw pattern claims, unchecked constructors, mutable pattern fields, and
post-construction root validation are prohibited. Solve construction derives
patterns rather than accepting caller annotations.

Certification receipts retain the semantic owner, source/generated
provenance, derivation rule, input/output identities, and resulting pattern
identity. Runtime IR need not retain a full proof tree. The intended formal
theorem is that dependency derivation never omits a coordinate that can affect
an output.

## Verification

- Unit tests cover every Solve operation and dependency rule.
- Negative tests cover malformed CSR/affine data, overflow, duplicates,
  missing provenance, and cross-owner identities.
- Property tests compare optimized derivation with an independent conservative
  reference interpreter.
- Sparse/color-compressed and dense executions produce equivalent results.
- Scaling tests prove compact affine metadata is independent of domain
  cardinality.
- Representative structured MSL models exercise the Faer consumer and record
  deterministic policy decisions.

## Implementation Plan

| Phase | Delivers | Promotion evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Checked canonical patterns and sound dependency lattice | Operation and negative tests |
| 2 | Constructor-derived Solve patterns and coloring | Artifact and wire round trips |
| 3 | Compressed AD and tensor-kernel consumption | Dense/sparse equivalence |
| 4 | Diffsol/Faer native consumer and deterministic policy | MSL simulations and benchmarks |

**Promotion:** ACCEPTED after phases 1-4 are implemented and all production
pattern entry points construct rather than deserialize or mutate raw fields.
