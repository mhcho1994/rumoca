# SPEC_0038: Unified FMI Execution

## Status
DRAFT

## Summary
Rumoca's sole internal solver boundary is FMI 3 Model Exchange. FMI 2/3 Model
Exchange and Co-Simulation are projections or hosts of that interface; eFMI
GALEC/Production Code is the primary safety-oriented code-generation path.

```

| Rule | Owner/Where | Brief Justification |
|---|---|---|
| All FMI forms consume one checked kernel | FMI lowering | Prevent semantic drift |
| ME and CS are capability profiles, not backends | target discovery | Avoid duplicate lowering |
| Native, packaged, and Wasm are deployment forms | FMI packaging | Packaging cannot change behavior |
| The only solver-facing model interface is FMI 3 ME | simulation runtime | Remove the competing private model API |
| In-process simulation hosts FMI 3 ME with Diffsol | simulation runtime | One lifecycle |
| FMI CS embeds an FMI 3 ME host plus a selected integrator | CS runtime | Reuse integration semantics |
| `rumoca-solver` implements the FMI 3 ME importer/host contract | solver facade | Solver code never consumes `SolveModel` directly |
| Numerical methods implement an internal FMI 3 ME-host integrator contract | solver implementations | Solver choice does not change model semantics |
| Private `MeRuntimeHost` implements `MeSimulationSession`'s sole FMI 3 ME master algorithm | solver facade | The session remains the semantic owner; initialization, Event Mode, discrete-state iteration, output scheduling, and trace roles cannot fork by numerical method |
| Default root-location accuracy uses the existing host time-roundoff policy, independently of state-error tolerances and state units | common host option construction | State accuracy cannot define a duration |
| Numerical plugins implement only `MeIntegratorBackend` | solver implementations | A new solver supplies numerical advance/reset; it cannot invoke FMI lifecycle transitions, schedule observations, or construct traces |
| `MeSimulationSession` is the incremental master algorithm | solver facade | Batch simulation, live stepping, inputs, reset, events, timeouts, and observation ordering share one state machine |
| `FmiComponent` is the only linked or packaged component source | checked FMI projection | Runtime and emitted metadata share one inventory |
| Component operations are exact FMI 3.0.2 semantic projections | FMI component | Private extensions cannot become solver dependencies |
| Integrator boundary values use checked constructors and private fields | solver facade | Invalid outcomes never enter the master algorithm |
| Native in-process calls may be zero-copy | FMI host | Preserve current performance |
| Completed-step callbacks execute their event/history dependencies and never evaluate state derivatives solely to populate a cache | FMI component | Numerical plugins request derivatives when their method needs them |
| A speculative event-left observation retains its sampled state and pre-callback FMU snapshot; output evaluation is deferred until publication is required, with the current component state restored on every exit | FMI host | Unpublished candidates must not force complete algebraic evaluation on every integration step |
| Repeated directional seeds may reuse a bitwise-identical settled coordinate | FMI component | Avoid redundant algebraic projection |
| Algebraic sensitivities may reuse matrices and factorizations only for constructor-certified repeatable primal/JVP blocks at identical full Y/P/time coordinates, bound to their issued block and immutable table/call context | FMI component | Seeds share a matrix |
| Algebraic sensitivity acceptance uses the solved direction's coordinate scales and a fresh original JVP at unchanged tolerance; primal matrix reuse MUST NOT reuse primal or previous-direction acceptance scales | numerical projection | A derivative direction can change magnitude independently of its primal coordinates |
| Root evaluation may warm-start its complete checked refresh plan from a bitwise-identical derivative-settled coordinate | FMI component | Keep roots on the same algebraic branch without omitting root dependencies |
| Derivative and root refreshes certify convergence of every recovered algebraic coordinate as well as the reduced residual; a reused derivative coordinate carries the same accuracy obligation | FMI component numerical projection | Small tear residuals can conceal amplified coordinate errors and move or erase an event |
| Torn coordinate certification bounds the linearized recovered correction before adding it to floating-point coordinates; a rounded no-op is not convergence evidence | numerical projection | Rounding can hide a large recovered-coordinate error |
| Reduced affine factorization solves the complete original right-hand side and recovers every coordinate, including during mandatory original-residual refinement. Failed reduced factorization or refinement retains the full implicit solve from the same arithmetic origin and unchanged tolerances. | affine numerical projection | Reduction cannot discard small-coordinate corrections or manufacture convergence |
| At a bitwise-identical derivative-settled coordinate, root evaluation may omit covered value stages and execute only a construction-issued checked-BLT remainder; it may omit the complete refresh only when that remainder is empty | FMI component | Remove duplicate work without turning a warm start into an unchecked semantic shortcut |
| Settled-coordinate caches invalidate on lifecycle or parameter mutation | FMI component | Never reuse stale algebraics |
| An empty checked manifold-projection artifact certifies that continuous-state projection returns unchanged without settling observation algebraics | FMI component | Do not execute algebraic work for a structurally absent constraint system |
| Wasm uses the FMI layered-standard WIT profile | Wasm adapter | Avoid a private ABI |
| Native and Wasm hosts expose batched state/variable access | FMI host | Avoid per-scalar boundary overhead |
| `rumoca-input` writes model inputs only through typed FMI setters | input/runtime boundary | One input lifecycle |
| Input mappings resolve to FMI value references before execution | scenario preparation | Reject unknown or mistyped inputs early |
| Input clocks use `fmi3SetClock`; structural parameters use Configuration Mode | input/runtime boundary | Preserve FMI lifecycle |
| Name-based private solver input setters are prohibited | bindings/runtime | Keep one model API |
| Native slot writes only implement validated FMI operations | linked runtime | Optimization is non-semantic |
| `rumoca-codec` remains bytes-to-signal-frame only | codec facade | Preserve transport neutrality |
| Codec/model mappings use typed batched FMI get/set operations | runtime adapter | One model boundary |
| Invalid codec/model mappings fail during preparation | scenario preparation | No runtime data loss |
| Transport crates move payloads and controls only | UDP/Zenoh/WebSocket | No model semantics |
| Transport timeout, disconnect, and failure remain distinct | scheduler boundary | Prevent false successful steps |
| Transport errors never become no-input or successful-step outcomes | scheduler boundary | Failures remain visible |
| FMI 2 and FMI 3 adapters share semantic state | FMI runtime | Reduce certification surface |
| eFMI GALEC/Production Code remains a main target | eFMI projection | Safety-oriented deployment |
| Symbolic targets project from computable checked Solve | analysis codegen | Avoid duplicate structural analysis |
| Every deployment form retains checked provenance | all adapters | Traceable evidence |
| Unsupported lifecycle capability fails before execution | capability analysis | No plausible bad results |
| Cross-form traces must be equivalent | conformance tests | Packaging is non-semantic |
| OMC comparison consumes a backend-neutral trace-runner contract | parity harness | Preserve evidence across hosts |

### Internal Solver Boundary

`SolveProblem` is compiler IR, projected once into an FMI 3 ME component kernel.
All numerical integrators use only FMI 3 ME lifecycle, state, derivative,
event-indicator, time, continuous-state, and discrete-state operations. They
MUST NOT inspect Solve rows, layouts, opcodes, events, or private runtime objects.

[SPEC_0044 §§6-8](SPEC_0044_FMI_EXECUTION_CATALOG.md#6-common-me-host-and-integrator-contract)
normatively defines the host, integrator, event-domain, deletion, and evidence
requirements. Plugins own numerical steps, never FMI lifecycle transitions,
output schedules, traces, or component-private Modelica state. Step clipping
preserves coefficient-dependent Jacobian refresh and convergence-estimate
policies (ME-INT-004).

The component-facing surface is an exact semantic projection of FMI 3.0.2 ME.
Host conveniences derive only from standard calls and the checked
`modelDescription`; no convenience reveals Solve rows, relation memory,
projection artifacts, internal delay samples or storage layout, or event
ownership. Namespaced annotations may mark a normal FMI variable carrying an
importer numerical bound derived from current Modelica expressions, or a nested
declaration's `input`/`output` prefix; neither is a private component operation
or storage view. The
strict surface and removal disposition are cataloged in
[SPEC_0044 §8](SPEC_0044_FMI_EXECUTION_CATALOG.md#8-strict-fmi-component-surface).

Native static dispatch, borrowed slices, and batching MAY optimize this
interface but MUST preserve its state machine and observable results.

Importer policy selects integrators under the capability and failure-preservation
obligations in
[SPEC_0044 §5](SPEC_0044_FMI_EXECUTION_CATALOG.md#5-automatic-integrator-selection).

### Bounded ME Verification Profile

The linked FMI 3 ME component shares its checked lifecycle aggregate and pure
properties between production and verification. Ordinary tests exhaust small
finite domains; Kani is reserved for symbolic floating-point and typed-state domains
that resist practical enumeration. Normative transitions, obligations, evidence
kinds, bounded domains, and claim limits are in
[SPEC_0044 §1](SPEC_0044_FMI_EXECUTION_CATALOG.md#1-bounded-me-verification-profile).
That bounded evidence does not claim arbitrary-model trajectory correctness,
floating-point accuracy, solver convergence, or end-to-end Modelica refinement.

### Phasing

Code movement MUST prove bit-identical traces against each phase's prior binary,
except where stated below.

| Phase | Scope | Exit evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Internal ME kernel trait in `rumoca-solver` and one `SolveModel` projection; migrate the rk-like session onto it | Bit-identical traces vs. the pre-migration binary; the rk-like crate links Solve IR from no dependency table except `dev-dependencies`, so no production path there can name it |
| 2 | Replace the transitional extended kernel surface with the strict FMI 3.0.2 ME component and importer contracts; construct one checked FMI component aggregate | Official-schema-valid model description, exhaustive finite lifecycle tests plus bounded symbolic checks where justified, and bit-identical traces except for separately proved semantic fixes |
| 3 | FMI CS profile as an ME host plus a selected integrator | ME/CS trace parity on one kernel artifact |
| 4 | Packaged FMU and Wasm deployment forms | Linked-versus-packaged and native-versus-Wasm lifecycle parity |

#### Acceptance Contract: the reduced state-only system

Phase 2 deletes the Diffsol backend's general/implicit DAE construction, so the
reduced state-only ODE becomes the only system a state-carrying model is
integrated as. Per SPEC_0008 *Acceptance Contract Before Rejection*, the new
rejection path ships with the shapes that stay legal:

- [ ] `EX002` (`SimError::StateOnlyPathUnavailable`) rejects a state-carrying
      model whose state-derivative rows read a solver coordinate that the
      algebraic projection plan cannot produce, or that does not present one
      derivative row per continuous state;
      accepts (a) models with zero continuous states, which keep the no-state
      runtime path, (b) models whose derivative rows read only continuous
      states, and (c) models whose non-state reads are transitively produced by
      the algebraic projection plan — including chains through several producer
      rows, and including algebraic counts far above any MSL model's;
      owned by `rumoca-solver-diffsol::bdf::require_state_only_bdf`, with the
      rejection minted in `rumoca-solver-diffsol::error::StateOnlyRejection`
      and bucketed by `rumoca-worker::failure_classification` at
      `SimFailureStage::BackendBuild`;
      evidence `rumoca-solver-diffsol/src/tests/state_path_integration.rs::state_only_bdf_accepts_projection_backed_derivative_dependencies`
      (acceptance plus its ablation),
      `::state_only_bdf_accepts_transitive_projection_dependencies` (chained
      producers), and
      `::simulate_rejects_an_unprojectable_derivative_dependency_by_name`
      (the rejection reaches the caller by name).

### External I/O Profile Semantics

`rumoca-input` and `rumoca-codec` do not select ME or CS and do not own an FMI
instance. The host that owns the instance compiles their signal mappings into
a profile-specific I/O schedule. Signal names, types, shapes, causality, and
value references are shared metadata; legal update times and lifecycle calls
are profile capabilities.

| Active profile | Input application | Time advance | Output collection |
|---|---|---|---|
| FMI 3 ME | Host issues typed setters in a legal ME state and processes required events | Selected ME integrator sets time/states and evaluates derivatives | Host issues typed getters at requested observation points |
| FMI 3 CS | Importer issues typed setters at communication points | `fmi3DoStep` | Importer issues typed getters after accepted steps |
| FMI 3 CS with Intermediate Update | Importer may update declared inputs only in supported callbacks | `fmi3DoStep` with intermediate callbacks | Declared intermediate variables may be read in callbacks |

Linked native simulation uses the FMI 3 ME row; packaged or embedded CS uses
the CS row. An unavailable update cadence or intermediate value fails schedule
preparation. Input updates MUST NOT be delayed, dropped, interpolated, or
replaced to make a profile execute.

FMI 2 ME adapts the same component state. FMI 2/3 Co-Simulation is an FMI 3 ME
host with an integration method and communication-step policy. FMU or Wasm
packaging adds only transport and resources. These projections MUST NOT repeat
Modelica, DAE, or Solve lowering.

### Target Surface

| User-visible profile | Solver ownership | Permitted deployment |
|---|---|---|
| FMI 2 ME | Host | linked native, FMU |
| FMI 2 CS | Component | linked native, FMU |
| FMI 3 ME | Host, including Diffsol | linked native, FMU, Wasm |
| FMI 3 CS | Component, optionally Diffsol | linked native, FMU, Wasm |
| FMI 3 ME+CS | Selected at instantiation | FMU, Wasm |
| eFMI Algorithm Code | Integrator/toolchain | eFMU |
| eFMI Production Code | Generated production runtime | eFMU, generated C |

CLI profiles select one generator's capabilities; independent equation lowering,
initialization, event, and state-machine code are prohibited.
A raw derivative-only C kernel may remain an internal fixture, but MUST NOT be
a user-visible target once FMI 2/3 are exposed.

Symbolic exports are not FMI profiles; a symbolic engine's FMI ME host role
is separate.

### FMI-LS-DAE Layered Profile

FMI-LS-DAE is a layered profile of one FMI 3 Model Exchange component, not a
second DAE lowering. The component remains a valid ODE-form ME FMU when DAE
mode is disabled and exposes its original algebraic variables and residuals
when the structural `enableDAEModeVariable` is enabled in Configuration Mode.
The checked-construction, tensor, lifecycle, packaging, versioning, and target
registration obligations in
[SPEC_0044 §3](SPEC_0044_FMI_EXECUTION_CATALOG.md#3-fmi-ls-dae-layered-profile)
are normative by reference. The target stays unregistered until both profiles
execute and their negative controls pass.

The computable primal `SolveProblem` is the required projection input.
Compiler-produced AD, Jacobian, and mass-matrix `SolveArtifacts` are a separate,
optional product: a symbolic backend may consume compatible artifacts or derive
them itself. Optionality is represented by the presence of the artifact product,
not by silent empty or default derivatives inside a claimed artifact product.

The OMC comparator owns model selection, time grids, outputs, tolerances,
diagnostics, and classification. Runners only compile executable artifacts,
enumerate outputs, execute requested grids, and return traces. Native FMI 3
and Wasm FMI-LS share this contract. The comparator and its inventory depend
on neither Diffsol nor a private Rumoca backend.

### Evidence

CI MUST test the exact standard version, interface profile, platform form, and
advertised capabilities. A profile is user-visible only after its mandatory
positive, negative-control, metadata, ABI, lifecycle, and execution evidence in
[SPEC_0044 §2](SPEC_0044_FMI_EXECUTION_CATALOG.md#2-standards-conformance-ci)
and its cross-form evidence in
[SPEC_0044 §4](SPEC_0044_FMI_EXECUTION_CATALOG.md#4-cross-form-evidence)
passes. Those catalog rows are normative by reference.
