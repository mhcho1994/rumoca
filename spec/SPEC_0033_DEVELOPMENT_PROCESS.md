# SPEC_0033: Development Process

## Status
ACCEPTED

## Summary
Development MUST follow governing specs, fix the first divergent layer, and
verify focused behavior before broad gates.

## Specification

### 1. Applicability

| Rule | Owner/Where | Brief Justification |
|---|---|---|
| This spec is mandatory for non-trivial development work | humans and AI agents | Same process for all contributors |
| Conflicting user instructions MUST be surfaced before proceeding | AI agents | Avoid silent policy bypass |
| PR finalization still follows SPEC_0025 | all PRs | Review policy stays separate |

### 2. Spec-First Triage

| Rule | Owner/Where | Brief Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Semantic changes MUST cite governing MLS and Rumoca spec sections before editing | compiler/simulator changes | Semantics need normative anchors |
| Non-trivial bugs MUST start from one concrete reproduction | bug triage | Surface symptoms are hypotheses |
| Triage MUST identify the first phase where actual behavior diverges | parse through runtime | Fix the producer, not fallout |
| Triage MUST reject plausible competing hypotheses with evidence | bug triage | Prevents speculative fixes |
| Fixes SHOULD land at the earliest responsible layer | owning crate/phase | Preserves upstream invariants |
| Later-layer fixes MUST justify why earlier ownership is infeasible | validators/runtime/templates | Avoids compatibility workarounds |

### 3. Evidence Requirements

| Rule | Owner/Where | Brief Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Bug explanations MUST include the real failing model/code path | triage notes | Concrete examples focus review |
| Expected and actual behavior MUST be stated plainly | triage notes | Keeps findings understandable |
| Relevant phases MUST be mapped from source to failure | compiler bugs | Shows first divergence |
| Semantic identity MUST be proven from compiler-owned data | names/symbols | Strings are not semantics |
| Namespace aliases and component instances MUST stay distinct unless spec-backed | resolver/flattening | Prevents false symbol merges |
| Before/after artifacts MUST prove producer changes for non-trivial semantic fixes | IR/DAE/trace outputs | Verifies root-cause ownership |

### 4. Compatibility And Strictness

| Rule | Owner/Where | Brief Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Default behavior MUST remain strict and spec-aligned | compiler/tooling | Avoids silent drift |
| Compiler-owned IRs, wire formats, and phase APIs MUST support only their current representation | compiler | Old internal contracts must not constrain correct architecture |
| A compiler representation cutover MUST remove the superseded reader, writer, adapter, alias, feature flag, fixture, and fallback branch in the same change | compiler | Prevents obsolete paths from bypassing current invariants |
| Unsupported compiler-owned wire versions MUST fail immediately | IR deserialization | Invalid input must not enter the pipeline |
| Source-language compatibility deviations MUST be explicit and opt-in | config/tooling | Users choose non-standard Modelica behavior |
| Source-language compatibility docs MUST name the requiring library/model and default | deviation docs | Makes exceptions reviewable |
| Validators/checkers MUST NOT be weakened just to pass failing models | validation layers | Hides producer bugs |
| Temporary debug probes MUST be removed before finalization | all changes | Keeps tree clean |

### 5. MSL-Backed Work

| Rule | Owner/Where | Brief Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Compiler quality claims SHOULD use MSL evidence when relevant | semantic/sim changes | MSL is the broad corpus |
| Failing models MUST stay visible in validation scope | MSL workflows | No hidden exclusions |
| Failures MUST be classified before policy decisions | triage reports | Separates bugs from non-standard input |
| Focused or partial MSL snapshots MUST NOT be promoted | baseline workflow | Prevents baseline drift |
| Commit-to-commit comparisons MUST use the same focused target list | regression triage | Makes deltas meaningful |
| External compatibility corpora MUST pin an immutable revision and run as bounded parallel gates | CI workflows | Keeps evidence reproducible without creating a serial CI long pole |
| A compiler- or runtime-contract cutover MAY reset incomparable floors only through a one-shot migration naming both contracts, evidence commit, exact stage counts, target count, and post-cutover failure and diagnostic censuses; the resolver MUST fail closed on any mismatch | baseline workflow | A stricter contract can change classification, but an unaudited reset could hide regression |
| Post-cutover ratchets MUST use the reviewed floor; migration cannot excuse later regressions | baseline workflow | Waivers are one-shot |
| A comparator-policy change MUST increment the gate schema and pin old/new strict-high counts, reviewed-boundary count, and exclusion-artifact digest; unrelated ratchets MUST remain monotonic | baseline workflow | An oracle-boundary change alters the denominator; an unaudited reset could hide regression or counterexamples |

Failure classifications:

| Verdict | Required next step | Brief Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Rumoca bug | Fix earliest owning compiler/runtime layer | Project owns behavior |
| Non-standard library pattern | Keep strict default; add opt-in only if approved | Standards stay default |
| Ambiguous policy decision | Stop and record the decision point | Avoids hidden policy |

### 6. Verification And Done Criteria

| Rule | Owner/Where | Brief Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Run the smallest focused check that proves changed behavior first | local workflow | Fast evidence before broad gates |
| Capability changes follow the §6a two-tier cadence | local workflow | Focused proof and cohort proof are different claims |
| Required PR gates are selected by SPEC_0025 | PR workflow | One review source |
| Commands not run MUST be reported with reason | final updates/PRs | Exposes residual risk |
| Work is not done while temporary probes or symptom patches remain | all changes | Prevents cleanup debt |
| Semantic work is done only after spec grounding, root-cause proof, and regression coverage | compiler/simulator | Fix must be defensible |
| Built-in targets MUST satisfy SPEC_0007's product contract | code generation | Excludes placeholders and lossy output |
| Repository-launched Cargo MUST derive `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS` and `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` from host topology unless explicitly set | developer tooling | Avoids nested oversubscription |
| Automatic Cargo budgets MUST reserve zero physical cores below 4 logical CPUs, one below 8, and at most two otherwise | developer tooling | Balance runner throughput and foreground capacity |
| Long-running isolated workers MUST exit when their parent control channel closes and MUST enforce a bounded resident-memory policy | worker orchestration | Interrupted gates must not leave orphaned or unbounded processes |
| Nix MUST remain optional; shells only provision prerequisites and exclude first-party outputs by default | developer tooling | Cargo/xtask remains canonical |

### 6a. Two-Tier Verification Cadence

| Tier | Cadence | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — focused + canary | Every capability change | Focused suites green, plus a canary delta in the working ledger |
| 2 — cohort sweep | Every milestone, or nightly CI shards | One complete 566-model MSL/OMC sweep at a named commit |

| Rule | Owner/Where | Brief Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Verification MUST use `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=4 RUST_TEST_THREADS=4 RAYON_NUM_THREADS=4` | local and agent workflows | Fixed concurrency budget |
| A capability change is complete only with Tier 1 focused suites green | all capability work | Focused proof precedes every broader claim |
| A capability change is complete only with its Tier 1 canary delta recorded in durable review evidence | PR / verification record | Deltas must outlive the session that produced them |
| The canary target set is the fixed 20-model list in `infra/verification/msl-canary-20.json` | canary runs | A moving target set makes deltas meaningless |
| Replacing a canary member MUST record the rationale and replacement in the same review evidence | PR / verification record | Keeps the fixed list auditable |
| Each non-simulation canary phase gets one 10-second attempt; `Sim` gets a 14-second parent watchdog around its 12-second solver budget | canary runs | One honest attempt per phase, no retry or default path |
| A canary timeout, panic, unsupported operation, or non-finite result MUST be recorded as a failure | canary runs | Retries and fallbacks manufacture passes |
| Tier 2 MUST cover the full 566-model set, either in one run or as CI shards merged by the fan-in job | CI / milestone | Cohort evidence without a serial CI long pole |
| Tier 2 is the sole source of cohort parity claims | reports, PRs, specs | One cohort number, one origin |
| A parity claim MUST come from the OMC trace comparator's agreement bands; `sim_ok` alone is completion, never parity | reports, PRs, specs | A trace nobody compared can be plausibly wrong |
| Initialization parity MUST use each trace's last row at the exact common start time; nearby positive-time rows remain trajectory behavior | trace comparator | Separates initialization from later events |
| Trace production, lossless finite-value transport, publication, and malformed-evidence rejection MUST satisfy [SPEC_0050](SPEC_0050_TRACE_EVIDENCE_CATALOG.md) | trace producers/comparator | Detailed rows remain normative by reference |
| The comparator's candidate set MUST be every `sim_ok` trace | `rumoca_model_is_trace_candidate` | Completion picks candidates; comparison decides parity |
| Every candidate MUST be compared or recorded under `skipped`, `missing_trace`, or `trace_nonidentifiable` with a typed reason | `sim_trace_comparison.json` | An uncompared trace must name the exact proof boundary |
| `trace_nonidentifiable` MUST be reported separately, excluded from the pointwise-comparison denominator, and MUST NOT count as strict-high, passing, supported, or certified | comparator and all consumers | Inapplicable pointwise evidence cannot become affirmative evidence |
| Stochastic non-identifiability MUST follow typed random IR; deterministic-chaotic evidence MUST record a positive finite Lyapunov lower bound, sample count, and artifact digest | trace producer | Classification is machine-readable evidence, not a model-name exception |
| A non-identifiability profile MUST list outstanding proof obligations; incomplete evidence MUST fail comparison | trace producer/comparator | Classification narrows the proof method but never discharges the proof |
| Automatic trace classification MUST NOT branch on model name, OMC output, or an observed comparison band | trace producer/comparator | Corpus-specific heuristics cannot establish correctness |
| A run whose comparator stage did not execute, or compared zero models, reports "parity unmeasured", not a number | harness gate, `verify msl-parity` | Missing comparison must be visible, not defaulted |
| A quoted number MUST state `models_compared` and the skipped/missing counts beside it | reports, review evidence | Partial coverage is part of the claim |
| Tracked comparator exclusions MUST explain why pointwise OMC comparison is non-identifying; they remain visible and non-strict-high but are not refinement counterexamples | comparator | Oracle-test boundaries must be auditable |
| An unmeasured cohort run MUST fail its quality gate, not pass with `sim_ok` | harness gate, `verify msl-parity` | A run nobody could check must not read as a green run |
| The cohort ratchet MUST be strict-high; strict-high MUST contain zero deviation channels | harness gate | One wrong observable falsifies parity |
| `sim_ok` MUST remain a raw execution count and MUST NOT be called supported, certified, or passing | reports, PRs, specs | Solver completion does not prove semantics |
| A package or stage simulation pass MUST require a comparable strict-high OMC trace | package pass-rate report | Near, deviation, and absent bands are unsupported |
| A full Tier 2 gate MUST classify every `sim_ok` as strict-high, tracked exclusion, or typed `trace_nonidentifiable` | harness gate | Every completion needs parity or a reviewed boundary |
| Every non-high result without such a boundary MUST be triaged as a refinement counterexample or harness defect | review evidence, issue/PR | Wrong traces falsify the claim |
| A counterexample MUST yield a general semantic fix or typed profile rejection | compiler/runtime owners | Model exceptions cannot establish correctness |
| Any actionable counterexample blocks merges, releases, and unrelated capability work until its count is zero | campaign planning, PR/release gates | False success outranks breadth |
| The actionable counterexample count MUST be zero before compile-frontier or unrelated capability work resumes | campaign planning, review evidence | False success outranks breadth work |
| Counterexample closure MUST be recorded per model as strict-high, typed refusal, or reasoned comparator exclusion | review evidence, issue/PR | Aggregates cannot close false success |
| Every closed counterexample MUST retain a focused regression for the semantic defect, and the originating model MUST remain in the next complete Tier 2 comparison | focused suites, cohort sweep | A repaired proof obligation must not silently regress or disappear from evidence |
| Tolerance changes, retries, and model-specific compiler/runtime branches MUST NOT close a counterexample | compiler/runtime owners | Exceptions in implementation cannot establish semantic correctness |
| Pointwise-nonidentifiable traces and oracle-test limitations MUST be tallied separately as non-strict-high | comparator reports, review evidence | Separation manufactures neither proof nor falsification |
| No validity check that reads simulation outcomes may run before the comparator stage | harness gate flow | A gate that aborts first destroys the measurement it judges |
| Every quoted parity number MUST name the Tier 2 run and commit it came from | reports, PRs, specs | An unsourced number cannot be rechecked |
| Parity numbers MUST NOT be quoted from a partial, single-shard, focused, or stale run | any claim | Partial snapshots are not cohort evidence |
| A Tier 1 canary delta MUST NOT be reported as a cohort parity number | review evidence, PR text | Tier 1 is a tripwire, not a metric |

```bash
# Tier 1 — fixed 20-model canary; the harness marks this snapshot partial.
CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=4 RUST_TEST_THREADS=4 RAYON_NUM_THREADS=4 cargo xtask verify msl-parity \
  --sim-targets-file infra/verification/msl-canary-20.json

# Tier 2 — full cohort; CI shards it as `--shard m/n` plus `--merge-shards DIR`.
CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=4 RUST_TEST_THREADS=4 RAYON_NUM_THREADS=4 cargo xtask verify msl-parity
```

#### Tier 2 parity-number acceptance contract

All rows are mandatory; otherwise the gate reports `parity unmeasured`.

| Requirement | Enforced by |
|---|---|
| Comparator ran, or shard bands were merged | `MslParityStageOutcome` |
| Reference exists and names `omc_version` | `MslParityMeasurement::measured` |
| Trace comparison exists and is non-empty | `check_comparator_evidence` |
| `models_compared > 0` | `MslParityMeasurement::measured` |
| Every `sim_ok` is compared or has a typed boundary | `quantify_trace_differences` |
| Band table has one row per target and binds its comparator output | `band_table::ensure_comparable` |
| Table counts and digest match its rows | `band_table::ensure_comparable` |
| A compared model whose run reported a projection block over the fallback rate (SPEC_0044 ME-PROJ-003) is banded `fallback` with its rate and the band its channels would take, never strict-high; the reference agreement counts include it under that band; a schema v2 table reads as fallback-free | `band_table::mark_fallbacks`, `BandTable::agreement_models` |
| Table bands equal the reference bands | `band_table_disagreement` |
| Full cohort can identify every baseline-certified strict-high model | `certified_cohort_regression_reasons` |
| No baseline-certified strict-high model departed or changed band | `certified_model_regression` |
| Reference `total_models` equals `sim_target_models` | `load_current_msl_parity_gate_input_required` |
| Reference has no OMC assertion failures | `load_current_msl_parity_gate_input_required` |
