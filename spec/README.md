# Rumoca Specification Index

Contributor-facing workflow commands referenced by the active specs are standardized through the
`rum` developer CLI. The main groups are:

- `cargo xtask verify ...`
- `cargo xtask coverage ...`
- `cargo xtask repo ...`

For setup and day-to-day usage, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Reference annexes

`SPEC_0040`–`SPEC_0044`, `SPEC_0047`, `SPEC_0049`, and `SPEC_0050` are REFERENCE annexes:
they carry the lookup catalogs split out of their parent spec under SPEC_0000
§3/§3a size budgets. Every row in an annex is normative by reference from the
parent section that links it (SPEC_0007→0040, SPEC_0029→0041, SPEC_0034→0042,
SPEC_0036→0043, SPEC_0038→0044, SPEC_0033→0050). `SPEC_0047` serves three
parents — SPEC_0045, SPEC_0046, and SPEC_0048 — and each gate row names the
parent rule it covers. `SPEC_0049` serves SPEC_0045 and SPEC_0048. It is bound
by SEV-001/002/007 (grammar and coverage), SEV-011/024 (contract
classes and element-kind splits), and TRP-042 (the capability profile keyed to
its rows). Annexes add no rules of their own; edit the parent when the
requirement itself changes.

## Deferred Specifications

Deferred specs are non-active future-work proposals. They do not gate reviews or
CI, but remain worth preserving because the design direction is likely to be
useful after the 0.9 stabilization work.
