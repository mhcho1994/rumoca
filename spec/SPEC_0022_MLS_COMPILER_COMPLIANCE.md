## 1. Key Definitions ([MLS §1.3](https://specification.modelica.org/maint/3.7/introduction1.html))

| Term | Definition (MLS) |
|------|------------------|
| **Component** | "An element defined by the production component-clause in the Modelica grammar (basically a variable or an instance of a class)" |
| **Element** | "Class definition, extends-clause, or component-clause declared in a class (basically a class reference or a component in a declaration)" |
| **Flattening** | "The translation process mapping the hierarchical structure of a model into a set of differential, algebraic and discrete equations together with the corresponding variable declarations and function definitions" |
| **Translation** | "The process of preparing a Modelica simulation model for simulation, starting with flattening but not including the simulation itself" |
| **Simulation** | "The combination of initialization followed by transient analysis" |

---

## 2. Compilation Pipeline ([MLS §5.6](https://specification.modelica.org/maint/3.7/scoping-name-lookup-and-flattening.html))

The MLS defines flattening as two major steps:

```
Source → Class Tree → Instance Tree → Flat Equation System → DAE System → Simulation
         (Parsing)    (Instantiation)  (Flattening)          (Appendix B)  (§8.6)
```

1. **Instantiation**: Build class tree (syntactic) and instance tree (with modifications applied)
2. **Flattening**: Generate flat equation system with globally unique variable names

> "An implementation may delay and/or omit building parts of these trees, which means that the different steps can be interleaved." — MLS §5.6

---

## 3. Data Structures

### 3.1 Class Tree ([MLS §5.6](https://specification.modelica.org/maint/3.7/scoping-name-lookup-and-flattening.html))

The class tree "represents the syntactic information from the class definitions" with "all modifications at their original locations in syntactic form."

### 3.2 Instance Tree ([MLS §5.6](https://specification.modelica.org/maint/3.7/scoping-name-lookup-and-flattening.html))

"It contains the instantiated elements of the class definitions, with redeclarations taken into account and merged modifications applied."

### 3.3 Modification Environment ([MLS §7.2](https://specification.modelica.org/maint/3.7/inheritance-modification-and-redeclaration.html))

"The modification environment is built by merging class modifications, where outer modifications override inner modifications."

### 3.4 Scope Chain ([MLS §5.3](https://specification.modelica.org/maint/3.7/scoping-name-lookup-and-flattening.html))

Ordered set of instance scopes for sequential name lookup until match or encapsulation boundary.

### 3.5 Connection Set ([MLS §9.2](https://specification.modelica.org/maint/3.7/connectors-and-connections.html))

Variables connected by connect-equations; generates equality or sum-to-zero equations.

### 3.6 Connection Graph ([MLS §9.4](https://specification.modelica.org/maint/3.7/connectors-and-connections.html))

Virtual graph for overconstrained connectors using spanning trees.

### 3.7 DAE System ([MLS Appendix B](https://specification.modelica.org/maint/3.7/modelica-dae-representation.html))

Hybrid DAE with the following variable classifications:
- **p**: Parameters (constant/parameter, no time dependency)
- **x(t)**: Differential states (Real variables appearing differentiated)
- **y(t)**: Algebraic variables (continuous Real, not differentiated)
- **z(tₑ)**: Discrete Real variables (change only at events)
- **m(tₑ)**: Discrete-valued variables (Boolean, Integer, enum)
- **c(tₑ)**: Condition variables (if-expression/when-clause conditions)

Equation forms:
- **B.1a**: Continuous equations: 0 = f(v, c)
- **B.1b**: Discrete Real: z = {f(v,c) at events; pre(z) otherwise}
- **B.1c**: Discrete-valued assignments: m := f(v, c)
- **B.1d**: Condition evaluation: c := f(relation(v))

### 3.8 Flattened Equation System ([MLS §5.6](https://specification.modelica.org/maint/3.7/scoping-name-lookup-and-flattening.html))

"The flat equation system consists of a list of variables with dimensions, flattened equations and algorithms, and a list of called functions." All name references replaced with globally unique identifiers.

### 3.9 Partially Instantiated Element ([MLS §5.6](https://specification.modelica.org/maint/3.7/scoping-name-lookup-and-flattening.html))

"A partially instantiated class or component is an element that is ready to be instantiated; comprised of a reference to the original element (from the class tree) and the modifiers for that element."

### 3.10 Instance Scope ([MLS §5.6](https://specification.modelica.org/maint/3.7/scoping-name-lookup-and-flattening.html))

"A node in the instance tree is the instance scope for the modifiers and elements syntactically defined in the class it is instantiated from." Starting point for name lookup during flattening.

### 3.11 Ordered Set of Enclosing Classes ([MLS §5.3](https://specification.modelica.org/maint/3.7/scoping-name-lookup-and-flattening.html))

"The classes lexically enclosing an element form an ordered set of enclosing classes." Nested classes precede their enclosing class; unnamed root contains top-level definitions.

### 3.12 Spanning Tree ([MLS §9.4](https://specification.modelica.org/maint/3.7/connectors-and-connections.html))

Constructed from the virtual connection graph by "removing optional spanning tree edges." Contains all nodes with selected root nodes and required spanning-tree edges.

MLS §9.4 lets the tool choose among the valid spanning trees. Rumoca's choice:

| Rule | Owner/Where | Brief Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Select one spanning forest per graph. Required (`Connections.branch`) edges are admitted first; optional edges are then admitted in ascending order of (smaller, larger) endpoint distance from the nearest root of their connected component, ties broken by the lexicographically ordered endpoint names; an edge is broken when it would close a cycle or join two definite-root trees. Distances are graph distances over all required and optional edges from the component's definite roots, or from the root that `isRoot` selects when the component has none. `Connections.rooted`/`isRoot` evaluation and connection-equation emission consume this one forest: every selected optional edge keeps its ordinary equalities, every broken one is replaced by `equalityConstraint` (omitted when zero-width). | `rumoca-phase-flatten` `vcg::build_vcg`, `vcg::spanning_forest` | The tree depends only on the graph and node names, never on `connect` statement order; a graph without overconstrained loops breaks no edge and emits the same equations as before, and the branch orientation `rooted` reports is exactly the tree whose loops the emitted equations cut; two independently chosen forests leave `if Connections.rooted(...)` branches inconsistent with the cut |

### 3.13 Root Nodes ([MLS §9.4](https://specification.modelica.org/maint/3.7/connectors-and-connections.html))

**Definite Root**: "The overdetermined type or record instance R in connector instance a is a (definite) root node." Represents consistently initialized overdetermined records.

**Potential Root**: Has priority value p≥0. "When subgraphs lack definite roots, one potential root node with the lowest priority number is selected."

### 3.14 Clock Partitions ([MLS §16.7](https://specification.modelica.org/maint/3.7/synchronous-language-elements.html))

**Base-Clock Partition**: "A set of equations and variables which must be executed together in one task." Different base-partitions can execute asynchronously.

**Sub-Clock Partition**: "A subset of equations and variables of a base-partition which are partially synchronized with other sub-partitions of the same base-partition."

**Discrete-Time vs Discretized**: Discrete-time partitions contain difference equations only; discretized partitions contain der(), delay(), or Boolean when-clauses requiring integration methods.

---

## 3.15 Key Algorithmic Processes

### Event Iteration ([MLS Appendix B](https://specification.modelica.org/maint/3.7/modelica-dae-representation.html))

```
loop
  solve equations for unknowns, with pre(z) and pre(m) fixed
  if z == pre(z) and m == pre(m) then break
  pre(z) := z
  pre(m) := m
end loop
```

### Clock Partitioning ([MLS §16.7](https://specification.modelica.org/maint/3.7/synchronous-language-elements.html))

Three-phase process after flattening:
1. **Base-Partitioning**: Group by base-clock inference, excluding sample/hold/Clock first arguments from incidence
2. **Sub-Partitioning**: Group within base-partitions, excluding subSample/superSample/shiftSample/backSample/noClock first arguments
3. **Sub-Clock Inferencing**: Solve constraint sets for base intervals and sub-sampling factors

### Perfect Matching ([MLS §8.4](https://specification.modelica.org/maint/3.7/equations.html))

"There must exist a perfect matching of variables to equations after flattening, where a variable can only be matched to equations that can contribute to solving for the variable."

### Initialization ([MLS §8.6](https://specification.modelica.org/maint/3.7/equations.html))

Derivatives (der) and pre-variables (pre) treated as algebraic unknowns during initialization, requiring 2n+m equations for n state variables and m output variables. Start values follow priority hierarchy based on model component hierarchy level.

An ordinary parameter (MLS 3.7 §4.5: evaluable, and neither `final` nor `Evaluate = true`) is determined by the initialization problem, which §4.5 leaves to the tool, so a guard reading one over branches with the same scalar equation count and the same unknown incidence is kept as a run-time branch; otherwise the tool determines those parameters during translation instead (structural selection), publishes them non-settable, and warns at the equation (WD001). A guard reading a non-evaluable parameter (§4.5: `fixed = false`, `Evaluate = false`, or a binding that is not an evaluable expression) is never selected at translation, so an if-equation whose branches differ in equation count under such a guard is rejected |

| FUNC-020 | Unfilled slots error | §12.4.1 | "Error if any unfilled slots remain after argument processing" |
| FUNC-021 | Impure inheritance | §12.3 | "If function declared impure, any extending function shall be declared impure" |
| FUNC-022 | Impure call scope | §12.3 | Stated of the written prefix: "With the prefix keyword impure it is stated that a Modelica function is impure and it is only allowed to call such a function from within: Another function marked with the prefix impure. A when-equation. A when-statement. pure(impureFunction(…)). Initial equations and initial algorithms. Binding equations for components declared as parameter. Binding equations for external objects." Rumoca enforces the first three plus initial sections and parameter bindings. `pure(…)` is recognized and erased during lowering, but it does not yet suppress the callee purity check (that needs a Flat-visible call-site marker; task #57), so `pure(impureFunction(…))` is still rejected by Resolve. External-object bindings are not yet constructible (ED019). Neither is advertised in the diagnostics as an accepting context while that holds. |

| FUNC-031 | zeroDerivative condition | §12.7.1 | "zeroDerivative applies only if inputVar is independent of differentiation variables" |
| FUNC-032 | External purity deprecated | §12.3 | "External functions not explicitly declared with pure or impure is deprecated." Such a function is normative-impure for transformations: "a function shall be treated as impure in the following cases (applied recursively): It is declared impure. It is an external function without explicit purity. It calls another function treated as impure, except when wrapped in pure(…)." The deprecation is a report, not a call restriction — MLS 3.6 §12.3 stated the report as a requirement ("a diagnostic must be given if called in a simulation model") and made callability explicit ("without any restriction on calling them"), which is the historical basis for accepting the call. Rumoca: WR001 on every such declaration; body recorded impure. The recursive third case is closed over the DAE call graph in `rumoca-phase-structural/src/time_invariant.rs` (greatest fixpoint starting from all-pure; a bare external is impure; the `pure(...)` exception is not honored, conservatively) and feeds the structural time-invariance proof (SPEC_0040 STRUCT-T03). |
| FUNC-033 | Functional param type | §12.4.2 | "Function type parameter cannot be type-specifier of record or enumeration" |
| FUNC-034 | Input default independence | §12.4.1 | "Default values for inputs shall not depend on non-input variables in the function" |

| FUNC-037 | ExternalObject lifecycle signatures | §12.9.7 | "Constructor has exactly one output of the owning ExternalObject type; destructor has exactly one input of that type and no outputs" |
| FUNC-038 | ExternalObject lifecycle calls | §12.9.7 | "Constructor and destructor cannot be called explicitly; each constructed object is constructed and destroyed exactly once" |

Implemented: the first-iteration restriction and the excluded clocked lanes, plus equation-shaped same-tick exchange inside the partition — the SPEC_0040 SOLVE-C57 owner (SPEC_0046), implemented toward the SPEC_0046 SDO-001/SDO-002 read semantics, with credit gated on the SPEC_0046 gates and acceptance vote: construction issues the ordered producer list and the runtime replays it, so an ordinary same-instant read consumes this tick's value while only pre/previous/sample(u) consumes a history lane, and an inactive guarded producer's target still holds (SOLVE-C07/C10) because its held entry value *is* its `next`. A coupled simultaneous discrete residual SCC remains a typed rejection with the preregistered SPEC_0046 SDO-021/SDO-023 ResidualSccOwner successor |

### 4.16.1 Rumoca Phase 5 Clock, StateGraph, Stream, Media, and MultiBody Scope

This subsection records the current release-validation scope for the Phase 5
semantic representatives. It is not a claim of full MLS coverage for these
areas.

- Clocked/synchronous support currently includes the MSL subset exercised by
  `Modelica.Clocked.Examples.Elementary.RealSignals.Sample1`: scalar/vector
  `Clock`, `sample`, `hold`, `previous`, and basic sub/super/shift/back-sample
  lowering paths that reach Solve simulation. Full base-clock partition
  inference, cross-subclock validation, and all CLK contracts above remain the
  broader compliance target.
- Static clock schedule inference currently supports `Clock(period)`,
  `Clock(intervalCounter, resolution)`, aliases that resolve to those forms,
  and `shiftSample`/`backSample` compositions over statically scheduled base
  clocks. `Clock(condition)` is preserved as a dynamic event clock; unresolved
  or unsupported constructor forms must report `ED009` before simulation.
  A Clock defined by a parameter-selected `if` (equation or expression form)
  takes the branch the parameter values select (§16.7).
- Clock inference (§16.5.1, §16.5.2): `subSample(u)`/`superSample(u)` without
  `factor` take the exact integer ratio of the source and target partitions'
  clocks, proven per component instance; a `sample(u)` partition is owned
  through the conversions it takes part in before any fallback to a unique
  model clock; declaration bindings and clocked `when` bodies contribute
  conversions like equations, and a `when`-body `if` whose arms state a
  conversion is decided by its parameter values.
- Clocked values: `sample(u)` of a discrete `u` reads its left limit (the pre
  value); a vector `sample` defines clocked discrete Real elements; an MLS
  §12.4.3 multi-result call equation may define discrete receivers (one pure
  call per discrete owner); the condition of an `if` inside a clocked `when`
  body is a clocked value of the partition; `firstTick()` (§16.10) reads the
  `previous` of a generated clocked indicator of its partition clock; the
  scalar elements of a discrete Real array may each be defined by their own
  row (`y[1] = u[1]`, a connection `d.u = y[1]`), oriented like whole
  coordinates and issued as one producer per array coordinate.
- Functions (§3.7.2, §12): `div`/`mod`/`rem` of Integer operands in a
  function body are exact Integer quotients (truncating `div`, flooring `mod`)
  in the typed Solve program, and a function-body quotient needs no event owner
  whatever its operands' variability.
- Event clocks (§16.3 Operator 16.4): `Clock(condition, startInterval)` whose
  condition names a scalar Boolean coordinate ticks when `edge(pre(condition))`
  becomes true, once per rise: a condition that stays true through later event
  iterations or events does not tick it again. Its partition's rows are guarded
  updates on the tick, ordered over the whole partition so a row observes the
  tick's values of the rows it reads while `sample(u)` reads `u` at its left
  limit (§16.5.1), before the tick's own `hold` updates;
  `previous` reads the value of the previous tick, and `interval()` (§16.10)
  is `startInterval` at the first tick and the time since the previous tick
  afterwards. `shiftSample(u, k)` of an event clock (§16.5.2, resolution 1) is
  the clock that skips its first `k` ticks and then ticks with it, for a
  `Clock` and for a clocked value alike. Any other clock conversion of an
  event clock, and a condition that is not a Boolean coordinate, are refused
  at construction.
- Clock arrays (a `ClockVectorInput`): each element of a clock array is a
  connection hub that carries the scalar clock connected to it; an element
  with no connected clock, or a clock array used other than through element
  connections, has no resolved schedule and is refused.
- Not yet supported: `Clock(c, solverMethod)` discretized
  partitions (§16.8.1), refused at construction when a clock-owned equation
  contains `der()` so a partition is never integrated continuously; external C noise generators with Integer state
  arrays (`Xorshift64star`).
- State-machine support currently covers library-style `Modelica.StateGraph`
  models that lower as ordinary discrete/event equations, with
  `Modelica.StateGraph.Examples.ExecutionPaths` as the OMC-backed
  representative. Full MLS section 17 state-machine operator semantics
  (`transition`, `initialState`, `activeState`, same-clock checks, parallel
  assignment checks) remain scoped by the SM contracts above.
- Stream/Fluid support is not claimed for the Phase 5 representative. The
  current `Modelica.Fluid.Examples.IncompressibleFluidNetwork` blocker is
  classified as `unsupported-feature:replaceable_media_package_lookup`, which
  fails before stream-equation parity can be validated.
- Media property/function support is partial. The representative
  `Modelica.Media.Examples.IdealGasH2O` reaches DAE/Solve lowering but currently
  fails simulation with `unsupported-feature:media_property_initialization_singularity`.
  Other explored Media examples expose constrained redeclare, partial-medium
  function-body, nonlinear-solver callback, and vector-slice gaps.
- Higher-index MultiBody support is not claimed for the Phase 5
  representatives. `Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Examples.Elementary.Pendulum`
  and `DoublePendulum` are tracked as OMC-backed structural representatives but
  currently fail because an `outer` component reference inside a nested
  component is not bound/qualified through the matching enclosing `inner`
  component consistently enough for DAE function lowering. The stable
  classifier is `unsupported-feature:inner_outer_qualified_lookup`.

### 4.17 Annotation Contracts (ANN)

| ANN-015 | Extent coordinate order | §18.9.1.1 | "Coordinates of first point shall be less than coordinates of second point" |
| ANN-016 | Inline expansion | §18.3 | `Inline = true` and `LateInline = true` propose including the function body at each call; `InlineAfterIndexReduction = true` proposes it after the function is differentiated for index reduction and before other symbolic transformations. Rumoca (SPEC_0040 STRUCT-T10(b)): a pure, non-recursive Modelica body that is one straight-line result assignment is inlined with substituted arguments (a body with an assertion, relation, or event-generating operator is refused), `Inline`/`LateInline` before index reduction and `InlineAfterIndexReduction` after formal-derivative construction; a callee with a derivative annotation is never inlined before index reduction, and external, impure, recursive, or loop-bearing callees are refused |
| ANN-017 | Evaluate folding | §18.6 | `Evaluate = true` on an evaluable parameter proposes using its value during symbolic processing, after which the value cannot change. Rumoca (SPEC_0040 STRUCT-T10(a)): evaluable parameters declared `final` or `Evaluate = true`, and dependent parameters whose bindings read only such parameters, literals, and constants, are replaced by their values in one checked reconstruction and exported as constants; `Evaluate = false` outranks `final`, and ordinary independent parameters and unevaluable bindings are never folded (ANN-009) |

## 6. Compiler Phases with Input/Output

| Phase | MLS Reference | Input | Output |
|-------|---------------|-------|--------|
| **Parsing** | §2, §13, App A | Source text, package structure | Class Tree (syntactic, modifications in-place) |
| **Instantiation** | §5.6, §7.2, §7.3 | Class Tree + root class name | Instance Tree (modifications merged, inheritance resolved) |
| **Flattening** | §5.3, §5.6, §8.3, §9 | Instance Tree | Flat Equation System (global names, connection equations, streams) |
| **DAE Formation** | §4.8, §11, App B | Flat Equation System | Hybrid DAE (variable classification, balance verified) |
| **Simulation** | §8.6, App B | Hybrid DAE + experiment settings | Time-series results |

### Phase Details

**Parsing** (§2, §13):
- Tokenizes source according to lexical rules
- Builds syntax tree per grammar (Appendix A)
- Loads packages from file system (§13.4)

**Instantiation** (§5.6):
- Expands class hierarchy via extends clauses
- Merges modifications (outer overrides inner)
- Resolves conditional components
- Creates instance tree nodes with applied modifications

**Flattening** (§5.6, §9):
- Resolves all name references to global paths
- Expands for-equations/if-equations to individual equations (note: array variables are preserved per SPEC_0007)
- Processes connect() to generate connection equations
- Handles stream connectors (§15), clocks (§16), state machines (§17)

**DAE Formation** (§4.8, App B):
- Classifies variables: p, x(t), y(t), z(tₑ), m(tₑ), c(tₑ)
- Verifies local and global balance (counting algorithm contributions)
- Lowers supported model algorithms to equations while preserving function
  algorithm bodies for codegen readability (per SPEC_0007)

**Simulation** (§8.6, App B):
- Solves initialization problem
- Integrates continuous equations
- Handles event iteration until convergence

### Rumoca Design Notes

The following design decisions extend MLS requirements for implementation:

- **SPEC_0007**: Array variables preserved with dimension metadata; scalarization deferred to backend-specific layers
- **SPEC_0007**: Model algorithms lower to equations when declarative; function
  algorithms are preserved for codegen readability
