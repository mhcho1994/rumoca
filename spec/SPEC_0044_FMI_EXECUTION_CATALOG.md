## Summary

Normative lookup catalog for the FMI execution and bounded-verification rules
owned by SPEC_0038.

## Specification

Rows and domains below are normative by reference from SPEC_0038.

### 1. Bounded ME Verification Profile

The dynamic FMI facade delegates to a private transition aggregate. Ordinary
transitions follow this table; snapshot restore is the scoped exception:

| Current state | Command | Next state |
|---|---|---|
| Instantiated | enter configuration when a structural parameter is declared | Configuration Mode |
| Configuration Mode | exit configuration | Instantiated |
| Instantiated | enter initialization | Initialization Mode |
| Initialization Mode | exit initialization | Event Mode |
| Event Mode | update discrete states | Event Mode |
| Event Mode | enter configuration when a tunable structural parameter is declared | Reconfiguration Mode |
| Reconfiguration Mode | exit configuration | Event Mode |
| Event Mode | enter continuous-time mode | Continuous-Time Mode |
| Continuous-Time Mode | enter event mode | Event Mode |
| Any non-terminated state | terminate | Terminated |
| Any state | restore a component snapshot | state recorded by the snapshot |

Every other transition returns a typed contract failure without mutation.
Terminated is absorbing except for snapshot restore. Evaluation checks its
lifecycle capability before mutation. Configuration and Reconfiguration Mode
rows are enabled only for components declaring the corresponding structural
parameter capability; components without it reject entry without mutation.

| Obligation ID | Obligation | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|
| ME-LIFE-001 | Construction starts Instantiated; transition relation equals the guarded table | Exhaustive ordinary test of 7 states × 8 commands with enabled and absent structural-parameter capabilities |
| ME-LIFE-002 | Rejected transitions preserve lifecycle state | Exhaustive ordinary test of the same finite relation and production façade |
| ME-LIFE-003 | Terminated is absorbing except for snapshot restore | Exhaustive ordinary test of 8 commands, 17 active operations, and 7 restore targets |
| ME-LIFE-004 | Bounded convergent events settle; divergent fixed points return staged non-convergence | Ordinary examples and property tests over finite divergence increments |
| ME-ERR-001 | Stage annotation is idempotent; innermost stage wins | Exhaustive ordinary test of 6 recorded-stage choices × 5 incoming stages |
| ME-BUF-001 | Invalid bounded inputs do not partially mutate state or host buffers | Exhaustive ordinary tests of the named invalid-input classes below |
| ME-BRAND-001 | Foreign value references, observations, and snapshots reject before mutation | Exhaustive ordinary test of the 3 capability classes |
| ME-STATE-001 | Snapshot restore re-establishes lifecycle and observable state | Exhaustive ordinary test of all 7 lifecycle states |

The Kani profile contains exactly this symbolic bounded property:

| Claim | Symbolic domain | Counterexample meaning |
|---|---|---|
| SIM-010 | Three arbitrary typed event-history lanes and ownership masks | Pre advancement can lose type fidelity or partially mutate on rejection |

Kani proves only this property over its declared assumptions and unwind bound.
This is bounded runtime-kernel evidence, not a proof of compiler semantics.

ME-BUF-001 covers NaN and infinities as time, event boundary, or one state;
length mismatch; non-finite, foreign, and out-of-range value references; and
nine host-buffer classes: oversized state output, undersized directional seed,
invalid crossing shape, undeclared state-event index, oversized nominal output,
oversized state input, oversized sensitivity output, non-finite indicator input,
and output-series column mismatch.

Harnesses call production property functions. Finite exhaustive tests and
property-test samples are validation, not proof. This profile excludes
arbitrary-model trajectory correctness, floating-point accuracy, solver
convergence, and end-to-end Modelica refinement.

### 2. Standards-Conformance CI

Passing a C compiler or parsing one XML document is necessary evidence, but is
not conformance. Each artifact profile requires the following evidence:

| Artifact/profile | Mandatory CI evidence |
|---|---|
| FMI 2 Model Exchange FMU | Official FMI 2 XSD validation; archive-layout and declared-source validation; importer build from packaged `sources/`; exported-symbol and lifecycle checks; instantiate, initialize, integrate, terminate, and free through the FMI 2 C API; trace parity with the linked checked kernel |
| FMI 2 Co-Simulation FMU | Applicable FMI 2 ME package checks; advertised CS capability and lifecycle checks; repeated `fmi2DoStep`, including rejected/failed step behavior; trace parity with the same ME kernel and owned integrator |
| FMI 3 Model Exchange FMU | Official FMI 3 XSD and `buildDescription.xml` validation; archive-layout and declared-source validation; importer build from packaged `sources/`; exported-symbol and lifecycle checks; instantiate, initialize, enter required modes, integrate, terminate, and free through the FMI 3 C API; native-array get/set checks when dimensions are advertised; checked-kernel trace parity |
| FMI 3 Co-Simulation FMU | Applicable FMI 3 ME package checks; advertised CS capability and lifecycle checks; repeated `fmi3DoStep`, including early-return, event, and failed/discarded behavior when advertised; trace parity with the same ME kernel and owned integrator |
| eFMI Algorithm Code eFMU | Exact declared official-schema revision; packaged-byte reference/checksum recomputation; GALEC parse/round-trip; generated-algorithm trace parity with the checked GALEC kernel |
| eFMI Production Code eFMU | Applicable Algorithm Code integrity checks; exact Production Code schema revision; generated-code compilation and execution; trace parity with Algorithm Code and the checked kernel |
| FMI 3 ME with FMI-LS-DAE | Applicable FMI 3 ME checks; exact pinned layered schemas and package paths; one checked DAE/FMI provenance aggregate; default ODE-mode execution; Configuration-Mode enablement followed by importer-driven algebraic values and residual evaluation; trace/residual parity against the aggregate; rejected mismatched provenance, missing residual ownership, invalid dependencies, and ablated manifests |

FMI Model Exchange event inventory has this additional checked-lowering
obligation:

| Obligation ID | Obligation | Owner | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| ME-EVENT-001 | `rumoca-phase-solve::fmi` constructs the ordered `FmiComponent` indicator inventory from continuously monitored non-scheduled Solve roots and continuously state-dependent dynamic-time rows; periodic-clock roots and parameter/discrete-only time events are excluded and announced through `nextEventTime` | checked FMI lowering | Linked state-dependent indicators change FMI domain; parameter-only and periodic events appear only as time events; constructor ablations reject missing, extra, reordered, duplicate, or scheduled indicator sources |
| ME-EVENT-002 | Linked runtime and codegen consume the same `FmiComponent` inventory; until generated C implements indicator evaluation and relation freezing, packaging an event-bearing FMI 2/3 component fails closed | checked FMI aggregate and codegen | Event-free linked/XML counts agree and validate now; event-bearing packaging rejects; generated indicator ABI, lifecycle, XSD, and linked/package trace parity gate removal of that rejection |
| ME-EVENT-003 | A checked C profile may retain parameter-dependent error assertions and parameter-determined discrete rows without advertising continuous event indicators. Admission proves every predicate and condition-memory producer independent of time, continuous states, and external inputs through the exact algebraic schedules and per-output typed pure-call dependencies, and orders the discrete rows by dependency: discrete equations read only parameters, constants, and equations already settled, and settle with the parameter bindings, so the continuous kernel may read them; condition memories may also read parameter-determined algebraics and settle after the algebraic refresh; no row reads a pre() value, and each pre() history is committed from its source after the rows settle. Evaluating the rows once in these orders is the event iteration's fixed point. It rejects relation memories, scheduled/runtime/clock events, event-edge actions, runtime, guarded, structured, or transactional discrete updates, clocked previous() history, and condition-memory or pre() reads by the continuous kernel. Predicates and original messages remain executable at initialization and after legal parameter changes; failed assertions return an FMI error. | checked FMI C projection | Exact RigidBody parameter assertions; invalid mass/gravity/inertia failures; state/input/time-dependent negative controls; official schemas and linked/package traces; `cli_target_fmi/typed_functions.rs` (a parameter-determined Integer discrete equation read by the continuous kernel, FMI 2 and 3, ME and CS); the packaged `Loops.Fourbar1` export. The same proof excludes spurious indicators in linked and packaged inventory. |
| ME-PARAM-001 | Dependent parameters retain ordered Solve initialization assignments and export as `calculatedParameter`. The C profile admits parameter-target assignments whose reads are settled parameters or constants and evaluates them once in dependency order, which reaches the runtime's repeated-sweep fixed point bit for bit. An initialization residual runs `SolveRuntime::settle_initialization_system` through the shared kernel: the bindings and the initialization projection plan alternate until the bindings stop changing; every residual row is evaluated on the settled coordinates (bindings and the uncertified algebraic refresh applied to a copy) at the FMI tolerance (`RMC_TOL` when none is defined), with the settled block Jacobian (the initialization residual's JVP at the settled view along its tangent: the update rows' JVP and the seed projection of the primary chart's complete algebraic plan, with its refinement, alternate until the update tangents stop changing, `SolveRuntime::settled_initial_tangent`; an exact singleton of that plan records its Jacobian for this alone), the combined solver-coordinate and parameter scales, the one-row relaxation, the scaled Newton step with its halving line search, and the complete-residual check of `project_initial_variables_by_plan`; the certified algebraic refresh then settles the coordinate. The profile refuses initialization rows over declaration seeds (which need single-row isolation and the forward initial Jacobian), homotopy continuation, delay histories, and retained state-manifold rows. A settable parameter whose value no emitted program reads (not a parameter binding, a discrete row, the continuous kernel, the initialization, or an assertion) was folded into its uses by the compiler, so a set could not take effect: the C profile publishes it as `causality="local"`, `variability="constant"`, `initial="exact"` with its folded start, and every set of it fails, in FMI 2 and 3 alike; the reads are taken from the emitted programs, never from names. Whether the DAE stage may fold ordinary non-`Evaluate` parameters at all is a separate follow-up gated on the MSL parity suite and is not changed here. A binding chain whose dependency levels reach `projection_policy::ALGEBRAIC_REFRESH_MAX_ITERS` is refused, because the runtime's repeated sweep fails to settle it. A coordinate the initialization projection solves is published `initial="approx"` (an initial unknown) and a discrete value a discrete equation defines `initial="calculated"` without a start. Legal independent-parameter changes invalidate dependent values before observations and assertions. Explicit scalar overrides retain their own values. | Solve lowering and checked FMI projection | MLS §8.6 and FMI 3.0.2 §2.4.7; dependent inertia changes, invalid inertia rejection, reset, and native scalar-override regression; `cli_target_fmi/typed_functions.rs` (an initial equation over a reconstructed algebraic solved to 1e-8, FMI 2 and 3, ME and CS); `Loops.Fourbar1` initializes through its two settled rows and matches the native OMC trajectory in the high band. |
| ME-PROJ-001 | A generated C component settles algebraic coordinates by executing the same checked refresh plans as the linked ME kernel: `ContinuousRefreshOwners::staged_refresh_steps` is the one ordered reading of each plan (a certified causal schedule; certified value stages; otherwise the causal schedule as a warm start followed by the complete simultaneous projection, so an admissibility check without artifacts accepts a plan only when every dispatch `RefreshPlan::possible_stage_schedules` admits is executable. A non-finite exact assignment or causal warm start restores the incoming coordinate and projects the complete simultaneous plan; a non-finite projection-stage seed restores exactly `projection_seed_rescue_targets` (its seed targets and the block unknowns), projects that block alone, and falls back to the complete plan only when that projection fails; a failed pure call restores the incoming coordinate and reports an error), and every projection block runs the linked `runtime::projection` algorithm (singleton isolation, affine solve with its reduced elimination and original-residual refinement, torn reduced Newton with certified causal and recovered-coordinate convergence, dense block Newton with seeding, nudge, and the branch-continuity step limit) under `rumoca_eval_solve::projection_policy`. The reduced elimination promotes a causal step to a tear in place when its guard is nonzero or its pivot is weak, under the shared admission rule `projection_policy::affine_elimination_capacity`, the layout's guard-step table, and the tear capacity recorded in each block descriptor, so a block whose issued causal order meets a vanished pivot takes the same torn arithmetic in both implementations instead of the full-system fallback (faer sparse LU in the linked kernel, dense LU in C); it declines to that fallback only beyond the capacity. One shared kernel (`templates/fmi3/me_projection.jinja`) serves every C FMI target; each C function names the Rust function it mirrors. Blocks with alternate charts, a retained state-manifold projection, or a row isolation no scalar program reproduces are refused before rendering. A reduced chart set with executable alternates is executed (SPEC_0040 STRUCT-T07 constraint-fold chart rows): each chart's refresh plans, projection blocks, and derivative kernel are interned into the one program table and dispatched by the active chart index; at a completed integrator step (the FMI 3 component declares `needsCompletedIntegratorStep`) the active chart's `sigma` is the linked `dependent_conditioning`, with nalgebra's column-pivoted QR and dot products reproduced operation for operation, the alternates are evaluated only when it falls below the keep threshold relative to its reference, and the decision, tie break, and hysteresis are the linked `decide`; a failed derivative evaluation is a recoverable discard; the transfer is the Event-Mode update, which restores the chart and coordinate on failure; and the FMU state carries the active chart, its keep reference, and any latched change. The generated component emits each issued exact-assignment program once and drives both refreshes from step tables in the issued order; it recovers each run of causal steps with one chain program (SPEC_0043 §6a, `torn_sweep_runs`): consecutive causal steps of one residual program form one run when one chain program answers them in order (`target_isolation_chain_program`): prefixes do not decrease, and neither a step's isolated value nor an operation of its prefix that can fail on its operand values (a singular dense solve, a raising pure call, a table query, a random-generator op, or a fold or conditional holding one) depends on the target of an earlier step of the run. The chain program computes exactly the per-step isolator values and declines at the same step. The kernel tolerance and certification mode are instance state: the certified refresh tolerance between events, and the FMI tolerance with the uncertified refresh (the exact-zero and scaled-residual shortcuts of the dense and torn paths and the plan-level scaled acceptance) inside the initialization of ME-PARAM-001. The sources compile as separate translation units sharing one header. An affine block's refinement decides convergence with the row scales at the refined coordinate without forming every one: a row within tolerance of its scale at the arithmetic origin (all block unknowns zero) converges when that origin scale came from a nonzero contribution or the row has no nonzero entry, since no contribution falls below its origin value while none overflows and a row without a nonzero entry keeps its growing fallback (a row whose origin contributions all underflow to zero sits on its fallback there and may form a smaller scale at the refined coordinate), and any other row forms its scale exactly, so the decision equals the full row scales' in both implementations. Both implementations take the tear Jacobian from the torn block's tangent plan (SPEC_0043 §6a), rendered from the one `TornTangentPlan` in its multi-lane or directional form; the plan also gives the recovered-coordinate sensitivities the certified convergence test reads. A declined plan, a non-finite entry, or a reduced row or column that is exactly zero declines the torn solve to the dense block Newton in both, and a torn block without a plan is refused before rendering; no implementation differences the sweep. The colored forward application of a block Jacobian evaluates each distinct program once with one tangent lane per color that calls it (the colored tangent plan of SPEC_0043 §6a, `projection_policy::COLORED_TANGENT_LANES`) in both implementations, and bit for bit as the one-direction calls it replaces; a block with a program that does not widen runs the one-direction calls in both, never a finite difference; only these tangent-lane programs carry tensor aggregates wider than the dual lanes, which the C renderer lays out in fixed-size instance storage and the Cranelift and WASM row compilers refuse. | shared ME projection owners and FMI C codegen | Bit-identical where the arithmetic is shared, for builds without floating-point contraction (the generated headers disable it under Clang, which contracts by default, and the C harnesses compile with `-ffp-contract=off`; an importer building with contraction enabled forgoes the bitwise claim): the torn tangent plan's tear Jacobian and recovered sensitivities in both forms, scaling predicates and floors, iteration caps, trust fraction, nalgebra-ordered dense LU (up to the sign of zero where exact-zero products are skipped), isolator poisoning, and dual-lane AD. Tolerance-level where the linked kernel uses a different linear-algebra backend: faer sparse LU for sparse-candidate blocks and the compiled or reverse-row Jacobian versus the colored forward application agree to roundoff, and the one-sided Jacobi SVD agrees with nalgebra's SVD away from the rank tolerance. The differential FMU-versus-in-process traces of `cli_target_fmi/projection.rs` (torn, untorn dense, dense with seeding, nudge, affine dense, affine elimination, block-local seed rescue; FMI 2 and 3, ME and CS, 1e-6 absolute on a 0.01 grid), its fixed-state refresh values against `eval_at` (1e-8), and its complete-plan fallback after a failed rescue, with the matching `refresh_projection_cases` runtime tests, are the lockstep evidence between the two implementations. `cli_target_fmi/affine_promotion.rs` extends that evidence to the promoted elimination: a block whose parameter pivot is exactly zero on every refresh and whose second, later pivot vanishes at one state matches the in-process trajectory (FMI 2 and 3, ME and CS) and the linked fixed-state refresh to 1e-12 relative; the linked unit tests in `projection/tests/affine_elimination/promotion.rs` pin the promotion against the full-system fallback per coordinate within 1e-9 of max(|x|, scale), the declines at the capacity, and the unchanged bits of a reduction that never promotes. On `Modelica.Mechanics.MultiBody.Examples.Loops.Fourbar1` the generated FMU with the promoted elimination matches the in-process trajectory to within 2.0e-9 of max(|x|, 1) on its outputs and below 1e-10 on its states, so a full mechanical loop takes the same promoted torn arithmetic in both implementations. `cli_target_fmi/chart_switching.rs` drives the `SplitCircleChart` FMU (FMI 2 and 3, ME and CS) through a full turn on the physical branch, four switches under a fixed-step RK4 drive, and an FMU state restored across a switch replaying bit for bit. `cli_target_fmi/torn_tangent_harness.rs` compiles the generated `TornTangent` `model.c` into a C harness and checks `rmc_reduced_jacobian` on two multi-lane blocks and one 34-tear directional block, each with causal steps, against the linked `TornTangentEvaluator` at the same point bit for bit. `cli_target_fmi/affine_guard_harness.rs` compiles the generated `AffinePromote` `model.c` into a C harness and checks the shared kernel's `rmc_eliminate_prepare`/`rmc_eliminate_solve` against an independent dense partial-pivot solve across every promotion path (no promotion, a tiny guard, three guards with one holder already a tear, a zero pivot, a weak pivot, and a guard with a weak pivot on one step), each to 1e-12 of max(|x|, 1) relative with the expected promoted count. |
| ME-PROJ-002 | The `algebraic_projection` capability is declared by the C FMI 2 and FMI 3 targets only; `validate_solve_target_capabilities` rejects it on any other target. `c-ode` does not execute projection stages: its contract is a stateless explicit right-hand-side function with no instance storage for the projection workspace, the incoming snapshot, and the warm-start coordinates the ME refresh reads, so a model whose refresh retains a projection block fails its `residual_equations` gate. `fmi-ls-wasm` does not either: it renders Rust, and the ME-PROJ-001 rule of one kernel admits no second, hand-written projection implementation. Follow-up: give `c-ode` an instance-carrying entry point that embeds the shared kernel, and let `fmi-ls-wasm` link the ME kernel of `rumoca-solver` rather than render one. | target capability gate | `backend_template_runtime_regression.rs` pins the `c-ode` and `fmi-ls-wasm` refusals of an implicit algebraic model; `targets_cmd.rs` pins the `alg-proj` column. |

FMI 2 and FMI 3 jobs use at least two independent compatible validators. At
least one executes the FMU. Validator and schema versions are pinned, and the
fixtures include valid controls plus deliberately broken archives proving that
each gate rejects malformed input.

An eFMI checker is evidence only for the exact emitted schema revision. Until
an official checker supports that revision, CI uses the official schemas,
strict reference/checksum validation, GALEC round-trip, and executable
differential tests; a checker for another revision cannot support a compliance
claim.

Capabilities absent from an artifact are tested as absent. An ME-only component
cannot declare Co-Simulation, and an FMU cannot claim clocks, native arrays,
intermediate update, FMU-state serialization, or directional derivatives that
it does not implement. Negative capability tests are mandatory.

### 3. FMI-LS-DAE Layered Profile

| Rule | Owner/Where | Brief Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Construct one DAE/FMI aggregate from the same checked DAE provenance | `rumoca-ir-solve::fmi` | Prevent mismatched ODE and residual models without a parallel IR crate |
| Preserve DAE residual owners, dependencies, and tensor domains | FMI-LS-DAE lowering | Never reconstruct from scalar Solve rows |
| Derive default ODE mode from the checked FMI kernel | FMI runtime | One executable model in both modes |
| Enable DAE mode only through the declared structural parameter | FMI lifecycle | Match the layered state machine |
| Expose importer-set algebraics and residual outputs in DAE mode | FMI adapter | Preserve the residual contract |
| Package revision-defined manifest and schemas under `extra/` | FMI packaging | Make the profile discoverable |
| Reject unsupported DAE forms before rendering | checked constructor | No plausible incomplete interface |
| Keep the target unregistered until both modes execute | target discovery | Schema-only output is not a product |

The target README states the first supported slice, and the aggregate
constructor enforces it. Readiness zero may identify a narrow pinned draft;
rendering still cannot infer residual ownership, dependencies, or shapes.
Updating the pin updates schemas, lifecycle tests, and negative controls.

### 4. Cross-Form Evidence

| Evidence | Proves |
|---|---|
| One checked-kernel artifact hash across profiles | Identical model semantics |
| ME host parity across two solvers | Solver separation |
| ME/CS native-versus-Wasm trace parity | Deployment equivalence |
| Linked-versus-packaged lifecycle parity | Packaging equivalence |
| Device/scenario input through linked and Wasm setters | One input contract |
| Codec mappings through linked and Wasm get/set | One model boundary |
| Injected transport failure tests | No false successful steps |
| Invalid input mappings fail before evaluation | No silent input loss |
| Batched boundary performance budgets | Viable interactive and production use |
| Multi-validator metadata, ABI, lifecycle, and execution tests | Substantive interface compliance |
| Identical OMC inventory through native and Wasm runners | Backend-neutral parity evidence |
| Revision-matched eFMI integrity, round-trip, and execution | Production package integrity |
| Injected unsupported-capability failures | Early-error behavior |
| FMI-LS-DAE ODE and DAE execution from one aggregate | Mode does not change model identity |

### 5. Automatic Integrator Selection

| Obligation ID | Obligation | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|
| ME-AUTO-001 | `auto` selects an integrator before time integration; it MUST NOT retry or replace a failed trajectory | An integration failure after selection remains the original typed failure |
| ME-AUTO-002 | BDF is eligible only when every initial-state basis direction has a finite FMI ME directional derivative after initialization | A locally undefined algebraic sensitivity rejects BDF eligibility while the finite value path remains executable by the explicit host |
| ME-AUTO-003 | Only the typed `DirectionalDerivativeUnavailable` capability result selects the explicit host; lifecycle, contract, assertion, allocation, and ordinary evaluation failures remain failures | Negative tests for at least one non-capability failure plus typed dispatch tests |
| ME-AUTO-004 | Explicit `bdf` and `rk-like` requests are never redirected | Backend-specific tests retain their requested success or failure |

The initial linearization probe is a capability query over the same initialized
FMI 3 ME component and the same `fmi3GetDirectionalDerivative` semantics used
by BDF. It is not a finite-difference heuristic. A model may have a finite ODE
value at a point where its directional derivative is undefined (for example,
`root^3 = x` at `x = 0`, whose algebraic sensitivity matrix is singular). That
is not a compiler-semantic failure and does not make an explicit integration
result less valid; it makes the derivative-dependent BDF host ineligible at
that point. A local partial that does not exist inside one operation (`atan2`
at the origin, `sqrt` at zero) is not such a point: every derivative site
applies the kink rules of `rumoca_eval_solve::reverse` and contributes a finite
value there. A directional derivative that becomes unavailable after
integration starts remains a visible numerical failure under ME-AUTO-001.

### 6. Common ME Host And Integrator Contract

The common host owns the FMI master algorithm; a numerical plugin owns one
numerical advance at a time. These obligations refine SPEC_0038's sole-host and
thin-plugin rules:

| Obligation ID | Contract | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|
| ME-HOST-001 | `MeSimulationSession` alone owns initialization, FMI modes, discrete iteration, time-event caching, timeout, inputs, reset, termination, output roles, and trace construction | One conformance suite over Diffsol, RK45, and time-only plugins; architecture rejection of lifecycle or trace calls in concrete solver crates |
| ME-HOST-002 | Batch execution supplies an output cursor to the same incremental session and contains no second event/integration loop | Batch/live event and input parity; call-graph architecture test |
| ME-INT-001 | `MeIntegratorBackend` exposes only initialize, exactly one accepted numerical-step advance over a host-provided derivative callback, that step's native continuous extension plus declared positive local order, and generic truncate/reset | Diffsol, RK45, and time-only implementations plus a compile-only unrelated solver containing no concrete-backend type and manufactured-solution order evidence |
| ME-INT-002 | No common type contains dense coefficients, RK stages, BDF history, nonlinear-solver state, Solve rows, relation memory, projection artifacts, or backend errors | Public-API and dependency scans |
| ME-INT-003 | Component, integrator, timeout, allocation, and discard failures remain typed; standard termination is successful `SimTermination` | Exhaustive conversion tests; `sim_timeout` remains a distinct 566-model bucket |
| ME-INT-004 | Full-step and backtracking Newton convergence checks update the numerical method's correction-norm history for accepted outer iterations; rejected line-search trials do not advance it. A new nonlinear solve resets its norm history, while Jacobian and timestep changes retain the method's specified convergence-estimate reset policy. Hard-stop step clipping applies the same coefficient-dependent Jacobian refresh policy as ordinary adaptation | Direct dependency tests for measured contraction across affine solves, rejection of a rate that cannot meet the iteration budget, retained Armijo backtracking, and an analytic stiff-circuit voltage at a shortened step; unchanged tolerances and MSL comparison |
| ME-INT-005 | A correction-based convergence decision describes the returned iterate: a correction whose estimated remaining error is used for success must have been applied, or the method must separately test convergence of the current point | A manufactured nonlinear root rejects a history-only change that accepts a still-pending correction |
| ME-INT-006 | A numerical method's nonlinear-failure recovery budget applies to one requested accepted step; failures in previously accepted steps remain cumulative statistics and do not exhaust a later step's budget. Failed retries within the same step remain bounded, including retries after a Jacobian refresh or step reduction | A manufactured integral with injected first-attempt failures advances accurately across multiple steps; persistent failures still reject the unadvanced step at the configured limit |
| ME-ZERO-001 | Zero continuous states select the time-only plugin after constructing the same component/session | Zero-state state-event, time-event, input, reset, timeout, and trace parity |

The public boundary aggregates have private fields and checked constructors:

| Aggregate | Construction contract |
|---|---|
| `MeContinuousPoint` | Finite time and values; state width matches the component |
| `MeAdvanceRequest` | Exactly one accepted internal step from the current point; optional non-crossable FMI hard stop; public yield boundary; optional soft nominal observation; optional positive finite `max_step_duration`; all coordinates are host-issued and ordered, while the duration is not a coordinate |
| `MeAcceptedStep` | Finite previous/accepted points of exact component width, progress beyond roundoff, positive declared local continuous-extension order, sampling covers the complete interval, and stop/yield/maximum-duration bounds hold under the host roundoff policy |
| `MeTraceRecorder` | Host-only constructor of evidence satisfying SPEC_0033's trace-producer contract; it emits `SimResult` only after successful construction |

No root result crosses the numerical-plugin boundary. The host retains the
full standard event-indicator vector from the previous completed step. For each
`MeAcceptedStep`, it samples monotonically from that host-owned point toward the
accepted endpoint, sets each sampled time/state with standard FMI calls, and
classifies the full `fmi3GetEventIndicators` vector with FMI's exact `z > 0`
versus `z <= 0` domains. Sampling resolution and location tolerance come from a
private checked `MeRootSearchPolicy` constructed by the session, never from the
plugin. Default batch and live option construction uses
`accepted_step_roundoff(start_time, scan_resolution)`, capped by the scan
resolution, for the root-location duration. State-unit rescaling must leave
that duration unchanged; representable rescalings of all time coordinates
away from the positive-time floor must rescale it.
Explicit root-location options remain separately checked durations. The policy
also owns finite positive absolute and relative
state-consistency tolerances. The session constructs it from host options and
the positive finite state nominals returned by
`fmi3GetNominalsOfContinuousStates`; a non-finite or non-positive nominal is a
typed construction failure. For endpoint states `x0` and `x1`, component `i`
uses `max(abs_tol, rel_tol * max(nominal_i, abs(x0_i), abs(x1_i)))`. Before any
interior use, the host samples both interval endpoints and requires componentwise
agreement with the checked points under that bound. The zero-state check is
vacuous.

On every Event Mode discrete update, the host consumes
`terminateSimulation`; true ends the iteration immediately, transitions to
Terminated, and returns successful `SimTermination` without another numerical
request, even if `discreteStatesNeedUpdate` is also true. For each
non-terminating update it accumulates the two continuous-state change flags.
After the iteration converges and before another plugin request, if accumulated
`valuesOfContinuousStatesChanged` is true it
re-reads the complete continuous-state vector and reinitializes the plugin at
that checked point. If accumulated `nominalsOfContinuousStatesChanged` is true
it re-reads the complete positive finite nominal vector and reconstructs the
private policy from the same host options. Both refreshes commit atomically; a
failed read or invalid nominal leaves no partially refreshed host or plugin
state.

The declared order MUST equal the native continuous extension's positive local
accuracy order for that accepted step; a higher-order step MUST NOT report order
1. A backend is admitted only after its sampler passes the solver-neutral
manufactured-solution convergence suite at multiple refinements, including
curved polynomials, inflection points, and equal endpoint derivatives. The suite
consumes the declared order and MUST reject a deliberately degraded linear
sampler. The host does not infer or reject interpolation order from finitely many
runtime samples: endpoint checks reject stale, misindexed, or non-finite
samplers, while convergence evidence validates the declaration. The time-only
case is vacuous over empty state. No solver representation enters the common
type.

The common root locator stops at the first adjacent sampled pair containing any
domain change, refines every changed indicator against that same host-issued
tolerance, chooses the least application coordinate, and derives the complete
simultaneous set there. It then constructs a private `MeRootApplication` from
the checked left/application points and full vectors. Before destroying the
retained interval, the host samples and materializes every pending nominal and
event-left observation and the application state. Only then is the uncompleted
trial endpoint discarded, the backend truncated/reset to the application
point, and the component restored there before the completed-step callback and
Event Mode. No sample is requested after truncation. A failure is typed
`RootApplicationUnavailable`; it does not enter Event Mode, clamp an indicator,
or repair evidence. Root-search types and capabilities are host-private and
have no unchecked constructor.

The scan begins at the previous completed point and never queries before it or
the last Event Mode boundary. Its checked policy limits every adjacent sampled
interval and takes its tolerance from session options, so a backend supplies
neither side of an accuracy comparison. One policy applies to every plugin;
scan resolution never caps the integrator step, and the host may sample a large
accepted interval at many checked coordinates. When several indicators change
in one accepted interval, the host refines all first observed brackets and
applies the earliest domain change observable at the checked policy resolution,
implementing FMI 3.0.2's closest-event obligation. An interior component error
aborts with its typed status; the host does not skip, subdivide, retry, or repair
that observation.

`MeAdvanceRequest` distinguishes three times:

Before constructing a request, the host resolves any hard stop or yield within
roundoff of the current coordinate without numerical advance: experiment end
terminates or reports, cached `nextEventTime` enters Event Mode, and a yield
returns the current coordinate. A current soft observation is materialized
directly. Every constructed non-soft bound is therefore strictly later than the
current coordinate beyond roundoff.

| Coordinate | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `hard_stop_time: Option<f64>` | Defined experiment end or cached standard `nextEventTime`; MUST NOT be crossed beyond host roundoff |
| `yield-time` | Public incremental-session boundary; MUST NOT be crossed beyond host roundoff and, on the reaching request absent an earlier event/termination, becomes the exact reported coordinate |
| `observation_time: Option<f64>` | Soft intermediate output; exact plugins land, retained plugins may sample from a private retained interval |

An open live session has no fabricated FMI hard stop, but `advance_to(t)` still
reports exactly `t`, so an input applied after return has the requested
timestamp. A plugin's accepted time may differ from a hard stop, yield, or
current-time-plus-maximum-duration only within the session's scale-aware
roundoff tolerance; the checked step normalizes a matching public endpoint to
the host-issued coordinate. This does not truncate/reset the backend. The
tolerance is solver-neutral and equals
`max(100 * f64::EPSILON * (abs(current_time) + abs(accepted_interval_duration)),
f64::MIN_POSITIVE)`. The common accepted-interval containment predicate admits
only finite sample coordinates inside the closed interval under that tolerance;
all plugins MUST import that predicate rather than restating it. A private
numerical trial may overshoot, but the accepted step may not. A public batch
call asks the common session to reach its defined
end once; inside that call the session issues one backend request per accepted
internal step and consumes intermediate soft observations. Thus the numerical
request, duration-bound re-read, and completed-step callback have one identical
granularity.

After the materialization and root-application sequence above, the host
completes exactly one point for every accepted interval: the accepted endpoint
when no earlier event exists, or the truncated application point when root
search finds one. When `needsCompletedIntegratorStep` is true it calls
`fmi3CompletedIntegratorStep` exactly once at that point; otherwise it performs
no such call. Required preceding nominal observations are already durable.
An unknown step event retains its admissible left coordinate, sampled states,
and pre-callback FMU snapshot before the callback or any history truncation.
If the callback requests Event Mode, the host evaluates and publishes that left
observation using the saved state before entering Event Mode. Every saved-state
evaluation restores the current component state on success, failure, or unwind;
an endpoint that produces no event discards its candidate without output getters.

Backends do not receive event-indicator callbacks and do not contain crossing,
root-finder, arming, application-side, or simultaneous-event policy. RK dense
coefficients and Diffsol interpolation are private implementations of the same
declared-order interval sampler. The time-only plugin samples empty-state
points. A third solver owes one numerical step, its native continuous extension,
and truncate/reset; event meaning and lifecycle authority are identical host
behavior. No common type contains any solver's dense representation.

`fmi3Discard` is a typed component evaluation result, not a promised universal
step-rejection hook. A plugin may retry only when its library can prove that the
trial was rejected without committing state. Otherwise it returns the common
typed `MeIntegrationError::ComponentDiscard`; it MUST NOT turn the status or
the library's exhaustion into a string.

Rumoca follows MLS 3.7 §3.7.2.1's variable-step guidance by respecting the
current minimum positive delay time to avoid delay-buffer extrapolation. A
delay-bearing `FmiComponent` therefore declares the optional FMI metadata and
normal Float64 variable specified in §8. The host discovers that annotation
from `modelDescription`, reads the value only with standard `fmi3GetFloat64`,
maps the declared maximum-finite sentinel to no bound, and places any remaining
value in `MeAdvanceRequest.max_step_duration`. It re-reads and validates the
value immediately before every one-step backend request; it never caches it
across an accepted step, completed Event Mode, input mutation, or reset. Every
plugin ensures its accepted interval duration does not exceed this bound beyond
host roundoff by a private mechanism that MUST NOT mark solver state modified
merely to enforce the bound. Scan subdivision remains solely host policy. A
non-finite or non-positive non-sentinel read and an overlong accepted interval
are typed failures. Component metadata and preparation rules are owned solely
by §8; `DefaultExperiment.stepSize` remains an unrelated ignorable initial
hint.

### 7. Common-Host Cutover Inventory And Differential Evidence

The cutover removes every alternate master-algorithm or zero-state routing
producer in one change:

| Removed surface | Disposition |
|---|---|
| `SimulationBackend`, `run_with_runtime_schedule`, `runtime::orchestration`, `LoopStats`, `runtime::driver`, `SolverAdvanceBackend`, `SampleRecorder` | Delete; numerical bodies implement `MeIntegratorBackend` |
| `runtime::no_state`, `fmi_me::no_state`, `rumoca-solver-rk45::no_state` and crate-root re-exports | Delete; the common host scans, while `fmi_me::integrator::time_only` only advances/samples empty state |
| Diffsol `RuntimeOnlyDriver`, `SimulationSessionInner::RuntimeOnly`, `PreparedSimulationState::NoState`, and both prepared/batch no-state call sites | Delete; common session selects time-only plugin |
| RK45 `SimulationSessionInner::NoState` and all dispatch arms | Delete; common session selects time-only plugin |
| Diffsol/RK45 root callbacks, crossing classifiers, arming state, application probes, and root-result variants | Delete or disable; common host scans every accepted interval through the required sampler |
| `runtime::event` | Delete; `process_runtime_event_boundary`, `RuntimeEventBoundary`, `RuntimeEventBoundaryOutcome`, `RuntimeEventBoundaryHandler`, and `runtime_event_horizon` move to the component kernel; both moved processing and retained initialization consumers replace `runtime_event_right_limit` with the sole `timeline::bounded_event_right_limit_time(event_time, horizon, tolerance)`, defined as `event_right_limit_time(event_time, tolerance).min(horizon)`; `runtime_root_event_application_time` is deleted because only the host constructs that coordinate; delete or update all crate-root re-exports |
| `timeline::event_right_probe_time` | Delete with the superseded backend and old `fmi_me` host root probing; the common host uses the least sampled coordinate in the entered FMI domain |
| Backend-owned sessions, recorders, `SimResult` builders, event loops, schedule rebuilders, and horizon extenders | Delete; facade clients wrap `MeSimulationSession` |
| Frozen compatibility methods, duplicate initialization, component `max_step_size`, private crossing/arming, and component schedule queries | Remove under §8 dispositions |
| `MeRootProfile::DiffsolFrozen`, `MeNumericsProfile::DiffsolFrozen`, and every kernel or component branch on them | Delete; FMI and Modelica fix component semantics, while numerical choices remain private backend configuration and no common type names a solver |
| `rumoca-ir-fmi`, `rumoca-phase-fmi`, `FmiComponent::construct(SolveProblem, ...)`, consuming `into_solve`, and the separate `new_owned_with_fmi` artifacts argument | Delete both crates without shims; move the checked aggregate to `rumoca_ir_solve::fmi`, move lowering to the always-available `rumoca_phase_solve::fmi` module used by the common runtime boundary, and apply the sole construction and consuming-view contract in SPEC_0043 §8 |

Every production consumer of the deleted delay operation has an explicit
cutover:

| Former production consumer | Common-contract mapping |
|---|---|
| `rumoca-solver-rk45/src/me_integrator.rs::proposed_step` | Read only the request's checked latest accepted coordinate and cap the private RK trial duration |
| `rumoca-solver-diffsol/src/me_integrator.rs::advance` | Enforce §6's non-state-modifying obligation while privately converting the request's checked latest accepted coordinate to a Diffsol stop |
| `rumoca-solver/src/runtime/driver.rs::bound_stop_by_delay_history` call in the runtime driver | Delete the artificial master-loop stop; the selected plugin consumes the same `max_step_duration` |
| `rumoca-solver/src/fmi_me/no_state.rs::NoStateOrchestration::max_accepted_step_size` and `runtime/no_state.rs::no_state_root_scan_step_ceiling` | Delete; the common host owns one scan policy and the time-only plugin has no root policy |

Backend-version-specific mappings remain adapter-local:

| Reviewed backend surface | Adapter mapping |
|---|---|
| Diffsol 0.13 derivative callback and rejection surface | Because the reviewed library surface has no fallible callback or uncommitted reject hook, component `Discard` and library exhaustion map to typed `MeIntegrationError::ComponentDiscard`; dependency updates MUST re-audit this mapping |

The evaluator oracle becomes test-only component inspection: two components
receive one standard call sequence and compare the complete solver vector,
parameters, relation memory, and delay state after each call. It detects
evaluator drift only; the sole-host conformance suite replaces the old
independent sequencing failure class.

This migration deliberately changes these coordinates and classifications:

| Change | Required comparison |
|---|---|
| Diffsol evaluates retained nominal outputs before the later accepted-point callback/delay commit | Delay-free and variable-delay traces; every changed delayed value explained |
| Diffsol suppresses only a nominal point immediately behind a typed settled-event semantic instant | `SwitchWithArc`, grid-aligned root, and malformed-regression rejection |
| Diffsol and RK45 stop detecting/reporting roots; the common host scans their accepted intervals, chooses the earliest crossing, and constructs the application | Delay-bearing, multiple-root, direction-sensitive, equality-departure, and simultaneous-root traces across both backends |
| A backend's native continuous extension supplies its declared local order, agrees at both endpoints, and passes the manufactured-solution convergence suite | Full-order versus deliberately degraded first-order convergence, inflection and equal-endpoint-derivative witnesses, and event-coordinate deltas for RK45, Diffsol, time-only, and an unrelated solver |
| Continuous-Time Mode orients exact zero for static domains and the frozen previous-completed indicator domain; Event Mode biases all zero values into the newly settled domain | Both crossing directions and tangencies for every `RootZeroDomain`, exact-zero Diffsol boundaries, roots without relation-memory targets, no no-op tangency events, and post-Event-Mode nonzero vectors |
| RK45 receives shared event-left/settled roles and removes tolerance-only sample dropping | Cross-backend event traces |
| Zero-state stops routing through `NoContinuousStates` / `EmptySystem` | Zero-state batch/live/error census including worker `ModelFailureBucket::EmptySystem`, `ES011_EMPTY_SYSTEM`, and MSL `sim.empty_system` consumers |
| Live sessions use undefined stop metadata plus exact yield boundaries | Native/Wasm step/input/reset parity and `terminal()` fixtures |
| Event Mode may change continuous states and state nominals | Dynamic-state-selection fixtures refresh both before the next request; invalid nominal and failed-read injections prove atomic rollback |
| Scheduled roots leave the FMI indicator inventory; dynamic state-dependent time rows enter it | Count/order, root, coincidence, and `nextEventTime` evidence |
| Component discard, timeout, allocation, and termination mappings become common typed outcomes | Exhaustive conversions and worker diagnostic buckets |
| Host scanning adds component evaluations while Diffsol truncation after an applied root restarts BDF order | Scan-evaluation budgets; grazing/double-crossing resolution convergence; evidence that non-event bounds/yields do not reset order/difference history, binding bounds may defer order growth, and actual roots alone restart |

Before deleting an old producer, compare event-free, scheduled-event,
state-event, simultaneous-root, zero-state, input-updated live, reset,
allocation-failure, timeout, and variable-delay behavior. Cross-backend OMC
parity includes `SwitchWithArc` and a grid-aligned root. A complete 566-model
run must retain `sim_timeout` separately and explain every trace/error delta.
Because this is a runtime-contract cutover, any incomparable certified floor
reset MUST use SPEC_0033's one-shot baseline-migration process; an explained
delta alone cannot silently change a certified band.

### 8. Strict FMI Component Surface

The linked component operation set is the implemented FMI 3.0.2 ME surface.
Host conveniences are compositions outside it. Current extensions have these
mandatory dispositions:

| Current surface | Required disposition |
|---|---|
| `MeTime::event_boundary` | Remove; `fmi3SetTime` carries only time and relations remain frozen in Continuous-Time Mode |
| Argument-bearing `enter_event_mode` / `MeEventEntry` | Remove; `fmi3EnterEventMode` has no arguments |
| `MeStepCompletion` | Replace with full `fmi3CompletedIntegratorStep` inputs/outputs gated by `needsCompletedIntegratorStep` |
| `project_continuous_states` | Remove from Continuous-Time Mode; Event Mode reports changed continuous states |
| `next_event_stop` | Host derives only from cached `nextEventTimeDefined` / `nextEventTime` |
| `event_indicator_crossings` | Host classifies checked raw FMI vectors; no relation-memory value crosses the boundary |
| `capture_pre_event_state` / `arm_state_event` | Remove; component updates its state in argument-free Event Mode |
| `max_step_size` / `delay_step_limit` | Remove; optional namespaced annotation plus a standard getter supplies a maximum step duration, while component `Discard` stays typed and root scanning remains host-owned |
| `observe`, recorder, initial-observation queue | Host compositions of legal typed FMI getters; not component calls |
| `restart_from_fmu_state` | Host composition of advertised standard reset/state operations |
| `extend_stop_time`, public `ensure_end_time` / `set_end_time` | Remove; defined-stop sessions reset to change stop metadata |
| Fixed directional-derivative helper | Host prepares value-reference lists for standard `fmi3GetDirectionalDerivative` |

The checked `FmiComponent` supplies model identity, variables/value references,
state/derivative order, event-indicator inventory, clocks, dependencies, units,
dimensions, causality, variability, starts, and ModelStructure. It obeys the
sole aggregate and consuming-view construction contract in SPEC_0043 §8. The
linked runtime receives `rumoca_ir_solve::fmi::FmiComponent` rather than a
`SolveModel`; concrete solver crates receive only opaque component/evaluation
handles. The always-available `rumoca-phase-solve::fmi` module is the sole
DAE+Solve constructor because every in-process simulation crosses the same
checked FMI ME boundary; the facade's `fmi` feature gates export APIs, not a
second construction path.
`rumoca-phase-codegen` consumes only the correlated view specified by
SPEC_0043 §8. The CLI requests this lowering only through the `rumoca-sim` facade
and has no production dependency on `rumoca-phase-solve`; the existing
`test_cli_uses_facades_not_phase_crates` architecture gate enforces that edge.

`fmi3GetEventIndicators` in Continuous-Time Mode returns each checked indicator
with exact zero oriented to `+EPSILON` for `RootZeroDomain::Positive`, to
`-EPSILON` for `NonPositive`, and for `Previous` into that indicator's frozen
previous-completed domain. The component owns one private domain cache aligned
with the complete checked indicator inventory, including indicators without a
relation-memory target. It seeds the cache after Initialization Mode and after
Event Mode, updates it only at a completed integrator step, and includes it in
FMU state and reset. `fmi3SetTime`, continuous-state setters, and getters MUST
NOT mutate the cache. An event-bearing Rumoca component declares
`needsCompletedIntegratorStep="true"` so the standard callback advances it.
The host alone classifies FMI's asymmetric domains (`z > 0` versus `z <= 0`);
exact-zero tangencies therefore cannot manufacture a no-op event.
`RootZeroDomain` is not a host crossing override. After Event Mode the component
biases every otherwise-zero indicator into the newly settled domain before
seeding the cache. Periodic-clock roots are absent from this vector and occur
only through the standard announced time event. A state/time coincidence enters
Event Mode once.

The maximum-step-duration annotation is optional FMI metadata and never a
private component operation. In Rumoca's namespace it names a normal Float64
local in the checked `FmiComponent` value-reference inventory with
`variability="continuous"` and `initial="calculated"`. The value evaluates the
current accepted coordinate's checked Modelica delay-time expressions rather
than delay history. When no positive delay expression currently constrains a
step it returns the documented IEEE 754 maximum finite Float64 sentinel. For a
checked Rumoca delay-bearing component, preparation rejects a missing
annotation, a non-Float64 or undeclared value reference, or an unreadable
referenced variable. The private `max_step_size` / `delay_step_limit` operation
is deleted. A Rumoca delay-bearing component declares
`needsCompletedIntegratorStep="true"`, because its accepted history is committed
only by that standard callback. The component's atomic typed `fmi3Discard`
remains authoritative when an importer ignores or outruns the hint. §6 solely
owns host discovery, fresh reads, sentinel mapping, validation, request
construction, and plugin enforcement.

General event-bearing packaged C does not yet implement this behavior. The
parameter-assertion profile of ME-EVENT-003 requires no continuous indicators
and retains its assertion lifecycle. Dated
disposition 2026-08-18: the common-host cutover adds a fail-closed packaging
capability check; ME-EVENT-002 gates removing it on generated indicator
evaluation, relation freezing, official schema/ABI validation, and linked/package
trace parity. Event-free packages continue to emit and execute an empty checked
inventory. No XML may advertise an indicator the generated component cannot
evaluate.

Aggregate construction and consuming-view ownership is cataloged only in
SPEC_0043 §8, shared-helper ownership only in SPEC_0041 §1, crate and module
ownership only in SPEC_0041 §4, trace validity only in SPEC_0033, and Rust
module layout only in SPEC_0021. The FMI aggregates above add no parallel owner
or maintenance rule.
