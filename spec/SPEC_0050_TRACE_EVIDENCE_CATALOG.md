# SPEC_0050: Trace Evidence Catalog

## Status
REFERENCE

## Summary
Lookup catalog for the trace-production, rejection, typed-exception, and
simulation-soundness rules governed by SPEC_0033 §6a.

## Specification

Rows below are normative by reference from SPEC_0033 §6a and add no independent
requirements.

| Rule | Owner/Where | Brief Justification |
|---|---|---|
| Produced traces MUST have finite nondecreasing time, unique channels, and rectangular data | trace producers | Interpolation needs a valid relation |
| Trace serialization and decoding MUST preserve finite time and channel values bit-for-bit, including adjacent event coordinates and signed zero | trace transport | Rounding can erase an event side and manufacture interpolation error |
| A time regression MUST fail unless the preceding row is settled and the shared predicate proves one semantic instant; retain that settled row unchanged | trace producers | Proximity alone cannot hide lateness |
| At one coordinate, settled replaces initialization, event-left, or nominal; event-left never replaces settled; exact duplicate nominal suppresses without reevaluation | trace producers | Preserve superdense role order |
| Published state events MUST use the common host application coordinate; localization and continuation coordinates stay private | ME host | Solvers cannot change trace semantics |
| The comparator MUST reject malformed time, names, or shape before interpolation and MUST NOT repair evidence | trace comparator | Oracles cannot manufacture evidence |
| A trace exception MUST be a typed row in `msl_trace_compare_exclusions.json` (schema `msl_trace_exceptions_v2`): kind `impure_source`, `reference_failure`, `model_issue`, `nonidentifiable`, or `comparator_limitation`, a reason, and evidence stating at least one checkable fact (channel counts, tolerances, event times, reference values); a cited repository artifact MUST name the commit that recorded it (an `msl:` documentation artifact needs none); an untyped or unevidenced row MUST fail to load | comparator, review | An exception is a claim reviewed like code; free-form allowances cannot be audited |
| A `comparator_limitation` row MUST name the comparator improvement that retires it (`near_zero_channel_scaling`, `event_instant_alignment`, `aggregate_tolerance_at_annotation_scale`, `angle_branch_aware_comparison`) | comparator, review | The end state is fewer exceptions through a better comparator, not fewer through refusal |
| The exception file a run reads MUST be the one the reviewed baseline boundary pins: the band table records its SHA-256, the quality gate fails when it differs from the boundary's `exclusions_sha256`, and the baseline ratchet reports a changed digest without a boundary pinning it as a regression, so an added or changed row needs a new reviewed boundary with evidence | band table, harness gate, baseline ratchet | An unreviewed row could otherwise retire a roster member |
| Excepted rows remain visible and non-strict-high but are not refinement counterexamples | comparator, reports | Oracle-test boundaries must be auditable |
| Simulation soundness: completions that are neither strict-high nor covered by a typed exception MUST number zero. Until they do, the baseline names each one in `unexcepted_non_high_models`; a current completion outside that roster fails the gate, so the roster only shrinks, and the PR report lists it by triage package | harness gate, baseline, PR report | If it compiles, it simulates correctly; a count alone lets one model replace another |
| A model class known to simulate incorrectly MUST be refused at construction (SPEC_0036) | compiler owners | A wrong trace is false success |
