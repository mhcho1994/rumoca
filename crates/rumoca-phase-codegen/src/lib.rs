//! Template-based code generation phase for the Rumoca compiler.
//!
//! This crate implements code generation from AST/Flat/DAE IR to various
//! target languages using the minijinja template engine.
//!
//! # Design Philosophy
//!
//! Templates receive a phase-specific semantic projection. A DAE template sees
//! dense checked variables, expressions, domains, and owner systems; a Solve
//! template sees executable blocks and their typed layout.
//!
//! # Template Loading
//!
//! Every render function in this crate takes template **source text**, never a
//! path: loading is the caller's, so that one renderer serves both a built-in
//! target and a user's directory target without a second code path.
//!
//! The compiler's own path is the built-in target bundles that `build.rs`
//! embeds from `src/templates/`. A bundle names its templates, its manifest,
//! and its assets, and it is what `--target <name>` resolves to:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use rumoca_phase_codegen::{render_template, templates};
//!
//! let target = templates::builtin_target("dae-modelica").unwrap();
//! let code = render_template(
//!     &dae,
//!     target.template_source("dae_modelica.mo.jinja").unwrap(),
//! )?;
//! ```
//!
//! A user customizing a target copies the directory out, edits it, and passes
//! the directory to `--target`; `rumoca-compile` reads its `target.toml` and
//! its template files off disk and calls the same render functions with the
//! text it read. A copied directory emits what the built-in emits, including
//! any `[[assets]]` bundle the manifest borrows with `shared_from`: those
//! bytes are read out of the lending target's embedded bundle, since the
//! borrower has no directory of its own to copy.
//!
//! # Writing Templates
//!
//! Templates use Jinja2 syntax. The DAE is passed as `dae` with fields:
//! - `dae.variables` - dense variables with explicit `role` and `id`
//! - `dae.expressions` - dense expressions whose operands are expression IDs
//! - `dae.domains` - compact structured iteration domains
//! - `dae.systems` - continuous, initialization, event, clock, and temporal owners
//! - `dae.modelica` - Modelica presentation derived from the checked arena
//!
//! Expression references are stable indices into `dae.expressions`:
//! ```jinja
//! {% for owner in dae.systems.continuous.owners %}
//! expression {{ owner.residual }}: {{ dae.expressions[owner.residual].operation.kind }}
//! {% endfor %}
//! ```
//!
//! # Custom Filters
//!
//! - `sanitize` - Replace dots with underscores: `{{ name | sanitize }}`
//! - Standard minijinja filters (length, upper, lower, etc.)

/// Built-in template sources.
///
/// These are embedded in the binary as a convenience. For customization,
/// copy these templates to files and modify as needed.
///
/// The template source files are in `crates/rumoca-phase-codegen/src/templates/`.
///
/// # Support partials and shared templates
///
/// A target directory holds two kinds of template, distinguished by the
/// manifest declaration that owns them:
///
/// * an **artifact template** is declared by a `[[files]]` entry and renders
///   exactly one product file; and
/// * a **support partial** is declared by a `[[partials]]` entry, renders no
///   product file at all, and exists only to be `import`ed, `include`d, or
///   `extends`ed by artifact templates. `embedded-c-galec/symbols.jinja` — the
///   single declaration site of the GALEC-derived C symbol policy — is one.
///
/// Either kind may be published to the shared render environment under a
/// globally unique name: `[[partials]].name` for a support partial,
/// `[[files]].shared_as` for an artifact template another target extends.
/// [`templates::shared_templates`] is that registry, generated from the
/// manifests by `build.rs`, and it is the *only* thing the internal render
/// environment registers — a template becomes importable by declaring it,
/// never by adding Rust.
///
/// Resolution order is deliberately flat and total: shared names live in one
/// global namespace owned by the built-in target manifests, `build.rs` rejects
/// a duplicated name, and it rejects any bundled `.jinja` file that no
/// declaration claims. An external (directory) target therefore cannot
/// introduce or override a shared name by copying a target directory; the
/// loader in `rumoca-compile` rejects such a manifest instead of letting the
/// copy's partial silently no-op.
