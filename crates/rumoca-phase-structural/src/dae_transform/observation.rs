//! Observation-only seam for structural index reduction.
//!
//! Every borrowed type here names data the reducer already computed to make
//! its own decision; nothing is computed for observation's sake. `observe`
//! returns `()` and its argument only borrows, so an observer cannot feed
//! anything back into the reduction it is watching — that is a type-level
//! guarantee, not a promise. `()` is the production observer: its `observe`
//! body is empty, so [`crate::prepare_for_solve`] allocates and clones
//! nothing for this seam. `ReductionRecorder` is the one observer that does
//! real work, turning each borrowed event into an owned [`ReductionRecord`]
//! for [`crate::inspect_prepare_for_solve`], the sole crate-external surface.
//! Everything else in this module — the trait, the borrowed event types, the
//! recorder — stays private to [`super`]. A stalled intermediate may also
//! transfer into the recorder when the reducer would otherwise discard it.
//! Consumers receive only extracted data, never the reduction protocol.
