//! Coordinate equalities the source system already asserts.
//!
//! A connected MSL model states most of its structure as bare additive
//! balances: every `connect` between two rotational flanges lowers to a
//! potential residual `a.phi - b.phi`, every two-terminal node lowers to a flow
//! residual `a.i + b.i`, a component body adds `phi - flange_a.phi`, and an
//! unused support adds `phi_support - 0`. Read literally, a chain like that
//! hides the fact that two *states* are the same quantity behind a run of
//! connector algebraics, so a candidate detector that only inspects one
//! residual at a time sees nothing to reduce.
//!
//! [`SystemEqualities`] closes those chains exactly. Each accepted residual is
//! an unconditional continuous equation, so `a - b = 0` proves `a ≡ b` and
//! `a + b = 0` proves `a ≡ -b` for all time; the transitive closure of those
//! signed edges is equally exact. Nothing here inspects a name: membership
//! comes from branded coordinate identities, and the class anchor is picked by
//! variable role and `StateSelect`.
//!
//! A rigid body writes its ends as `flange_a.s - (s - L/2)`, which states the
//! same equality displaced by a time-invariant length. That displacement is
//! exact for a derivative — `d/dt (x + c) = d/dt x` whenever `c` is constant —
//! and inexact for a value, so the two facts are closed separately. The
//! `exact` layer carries only offset-free edges and answers value questions;
//! the `affine` layer additionally carries displaced edges and answers
//! derivative questions. Every reader picks the layer its claim needs, so an
//! offset can never leak into a substitution that names a value.
