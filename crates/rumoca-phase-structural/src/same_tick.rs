//! Construction-issued same-tick producer ordering for clocked discrete owners.
//!
//! This is the structural half of the SPEC_0040 `SOLVE-C57`
//! `ClockPartitionTransactionProgram` design
//! (SPEC_0046 §2/§6 step 3),
//! implemented toward the SPEC_0046 SDO-001/SDO-002 semantics: inside one
//! event/clock tick an ordinary same-instant read consumes this tick's value
//! (`next`), and only an explicit `pre`, `previous`, or `sample(u)` consumes
//! its named history lane.
//!
//! The caller (Solve lowering) describes each clocked producer — its complete
//! target tuple and the expressions and conditions it evaluates at the tick —
//! and this module *issues* the executable order: a topological schedule of
//! producers by their same-instant reads, alias-followed through the exact
//! definitions of [`SameTickDefinitions`]. Rank is the issued position; no
//! consumer recovers it by searching an order list or by matching targets,
//! names, spans, or provenance.
//!
//! An algebraic intermediate on a same-tick path between two producers (an
//! alias chain such as `slow = fastAlias; fastAlias = fast`) is issued as its
//! own [`SameTickStep::IntermediateDefinition`] step, ordered after the
//! producers it reads and before the producers that read it. The runtime
//! refreshes it into private work state so later producers observe this tick's
//! value; it is never committed by the discrete pass ("intermediates become
//! visible to later producers without committing unrelated targets").
//!
//! [`SameTickDefinitions`] is deliberately wider than [`CausalDefinitions`]:
//! the proven acyclic algebraic elimination only orients whole *algebraic*
//! coordinates whose value type matches exactly, so `Real nAlias = n` with an
//! `Integer` producer `n`, `Integer nAlias = n`, and a connector-routed
//! `Integer` port all fall outside it. Those are precisely the RDD2/eFMI
//! mode/status-code shapes, so this module derives its own exact
//! single-writer definitions for them (SPEC_0046 SDO-002) and *fails
//! construction* rather than assuming a read whose producer-reachable owner it
//! cannot refresh is already current at tick entry.
//!
//! A directed cycle among same-tick reads with no `pre`/`previous` boundary is
//! a construction-time rejection at the blocked producer's span (the MLS
//! Appendix B discrete algebraic-loop rule), never a runtime fallback.
