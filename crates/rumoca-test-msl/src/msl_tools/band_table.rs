//! Per-model agreement-band table: the certification artifact that makes the
//! compared set explicit.
//!
//! # Why this artifact exists
//!
//! The OMC comparator publishes aggregate band counts (`agreement_high`,
//! `agreement_minor`, `agreement_deviation`) plus a `models` map keyed by the
//! models it actually compared. A model that stops being comparable — it no
//! longer simulates, its OMC reference went missing, it was added to the
//! exclusion list — disappears from that map with no record. The counts still
//! add up, so two certifications can be compared number-to-number while the
//! *populations* behind those numbers differ.
//!
//! That is not a hypothetical. Between `results-wave3-omcref` and
//! `results-landed`, `Modelica.Electrical.Machines.Examples.DCMachines.DCPM_Start`
//! went from 165 strict-high channels to `sim_solver_fail` and vanished from
//! `.models`; `...RealSignals.Sample3` and `...OpAmps.SignalGenerator` left the
//! same way. Nothing in either certification named the departure.
//!
//! [`BandTable`] fixes that by writing one row **per cohort model** — every
//! model in the run's `sim_target_models` roster, not just the compared ones. A
//! model that is not in the compared set still gets a row, and that row carries
//! a mandatory [`ExitReason`]. Leaving the compared set is therefore a recorded
//! fact rather than an absence.
//!
//! # Acceptance contract (SPEC 0008)
//!
//! A certification artifact is **comparable** — i.e. [`ensure_comparable`]
//! accepts it — exactly when it carries:
//!
//! * `schema == `[`BAND_TABLE_SCHEMA`] and a `schema_version` this build knows
//!   ([`BAND_TABLE_SCHEMA_VERSION`]); an unknown schema is not silently read as
//!   an empty table.
//! * a `source` binding it to the comparator output it was derived from (the
//!   content hash of that run's `sim_trace_comparison.json`), so a table planted
//!   from another run is not read as this run's evidence,
//! * a `git_commit`, so its numbers can be traced to the code that produced them,
//! * a cohort roster (`cohort_roster_models`, the run's `sim_target_models`)
//!   with exactly that many rows, so the row set **is** the cohort and not
//!   "whatever the comparator happened to mention",
//! * at least one **compared** row, so the run has a band population at all,
//! * a unique `model_name` per row, so `left`/`entered` are set operations and
//!   not a bag count,
//! * every non-`absent` row carrying its channel counts (`compared_variables >
//!   0`) and no exit reason,
//! * every `absent` row carrying a named [`ExitReason`] and no band metrics, and
//! * `counts` and `rows_digest` that recompute from the rows, so the table is
//!   self-verifying: a band relabelled by hand or a count edited upward is
//!   refused even though every input binding is still intact.
//!
//! It **rejects** — loudly, never by degrading to a partial reading — every
//! violation above. A rejected table is not comparable: consumers must report
//! "not comparable" rather than diff against it.
//!
//! [`load_bound_band_table`] adds the binding check on top: a persisted table
//! whose `source` hashes do not match the artifacts sitting in the directory is
//! refused, because it describes some other run's comparator output.
//! [`ensure_diffable_pair`] adds the last one: two tables of different run scope
//! are two populations, and their difference is not cohort movement.
//!
//! # Rotation, once per comparator output
//!
//! [`persist_band_table`] keys the previous table on **run identity** — the
//! content hash of the comparator output the table was derived from. Re-running
//! the tool over an unchanged results directory therefore rewrites the same
//! table in place and leaves `msl_band_table_previous.json` alone, instead of
//! rotating a run's own table into the "previous" slot and diffing it against
//! itself. Only a genuinely new comparator output rotates.
//!
//! The previous slot is the **predecessor certification**, whether the last run
//! rotated it there, CI restored it there before this run, or a rotation crashed
//! before its write. A full-cohort run with no predecessor cannot state its
//! cohort movement, and the quality gate fails it rather than passing with the
//! movement rules inert.
//!
//! Owner: this module. The band classifier itself is
//! [`rumoca_sim::sim_trace_compare::classify_trace_metric_channel_distribution`];
//! this module only records what that classifier decided, per model, alongside
//! the reason every other cohort model was not classified at all.
