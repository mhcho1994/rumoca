//! Typed outcome of the Tier 2 OMC trace-comparator stage.
//!
//! # Why this type exists
//!
//! `sim_ok` is completion, never parity (SPEC 0033, `38464fd8`). A parity claim
//! may only come from the OMC comparator's agreement bands. Before this module
//! the harness carried the comparator reading as a bare
//! `Option<MslParityGateInput>`: `None` meant "no comparator output", and every
//! consumer silently defaulted — the trace gate printed nothing, the ratchet
//! skipped its trace reasons, and the run's only surviving number was `sim_ok`.
//! That is exactly how the `results-wave3` sweep published `sim_ok 49/566` with
//! no comparison behind it.
//!
//! [`MslParityMeasurement`] makes the absent state *unrepresentable without a
//! reason*: a run either carries a checked [`MslParityGateInput`] or it carries
//! a named [`MslParityUnmeasuredReason`]. There is no third state and no
//! default, so "the comparator did not run" cannot be spelled the same way as
//! "the comparator ran and found nothing wrong".
//!
//! # Cohort pinning
//!
//! Aggregate band counts do not pin the population behind them. A model can
//! stop simulating, disappear from the comparator's `models` map, and leave the
//! headline `agreement_high` unchanged — which is how `DCPM_Start` regressed
//! from strict-high to `sim_solver_fail` with no run naming it. So the strict-
//! high count this module quotes comes from the **persisted per-model band
//! table** ([`rumoca_test_msl::msl_tools::band_table`]), not from the
//! reference's summary field, and the two must agree.
//!
//! The table is derived from this run's comparator output once per process
//! ([`cohort_reading`]) and written to the results directory, rotating an
//! *earlier run's* table to `msl_band_table_previous.json`. That single seam
//! covers both the un-sharded run and the shard fan-in, which merges comparator
//! artifacts without running the comparator stage itself.
//!
//! The run's scope travels with the table, and it is the same predicate the gate
//! skips on: a focused, subset, or sharded run writes a `partial` table. A CI
//! shard still writes one — its results directory is its own — while a focused
//! run over a directory that already holds the cohort's `full` table declines to
//! displace it and states that it did.
//!
//! # Acceptance contract (SPEC 0008)
//!
//! [`MslParityMeasurement::measured`] is the only constructor of the `Measured`
//! variant, and it **accepts** exactly a reading that carries:
//!
//! * `omc_version` metadata (so the reading names the OMC it came from),
//! * `trace_accuracy_stats` with `models_compared > 0`,
//! * a strict-high band count that is representable as a fraction of
//!   `models_compared`,
//! * a comparable per-model band table (see
//!   [`rumoca_test_msl::msl_tools::band_table::ensure_comparable`]) whose
//!   compared, strict-high, near, and deviation counts all equal the
//!   reference's.
//!
//! It **rejects** — by demoting to `Unmeasured(...)`, never by silently keeping
//! a partial reading — a reference missing trace statistics, a reference whose
//! comparator compared zero models, a reference with no OMC version, a run
//! whose band table could not be built or persisted, and a band table that
//! disagrees with the reference on any band. Owner: this module; the on-disk
//! shapes it reads are written by `rumoca-msl-tools omc-simulation-reference`
//! (the reference) and by
//! [`rumoca_test_msl::msl_tools::band_table::persist_band_table`] (the table).
//!
//! A demoted reading is not a soft failure: on a baseline-relative Tier 2 run
//! [`MslParityMeasurement::gate_failure_reason`] turns it into a gate reason, so
//! an incomplete reference fails the run rather than shrinking it to `sim_ok`.
//!
//! Previous-table transitions remain diagnostic output. The quality ratchet is
//! owned by the resolved baseline's exact strict-high roster; an arbitrary
//! earlier workflow artifact is not certification evidence.
