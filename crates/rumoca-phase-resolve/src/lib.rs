//! Name resolution phase for the Rumoca compiler.
//!
//! This phase walks the Class Tree (AST) and:
//! 1. Assigns DefIds to all definitions (classes, components)
//! 2. Builds the ScopeTree for name lookup
//! 3. Populates the def_id and scope_id fields
//!
//! The input is a `ParsedTree` and the output is a `ResolvedTree`.
//! Both wrap the same underlying `ClassTree`, but the newtype wrappers
//! provide compile-time guarantees about which phase has been completed.
//!
//! ## Module Organization
//!
//! The resolver is split into focused modules:
//! - `errors` - Error types for name resolution
//! - `registration` - Phase 1: DefId allocation and scope creation
//! - `extends` - Phase 2a: Import and extends resolution
//! - `inherited_scopes` - Phase 2b: Effective inherited scope entries
//! - `contents` - Phase 2c: Equation, statement, expression resolution
//! - `cycles` - Phase 3: Inheritance cycle detection
//! - `lookup` - Name lookup helpers
//! - [`validation`] - Post-resolution validation (unresolved symbol detection)
