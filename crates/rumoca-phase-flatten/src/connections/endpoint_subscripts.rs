//! Connect endpoints checked against the declarations they name
//! (MLS §10.5 / §9.1).
//!
//! [`ConnectionEndpointIndex`] indexes every declared component occurrence of an
//! instance overlay, and judges connect endpoints against that index: the
//! `EF026` rejection of a subscript applied to a declaration proven to carry no
//! dimensions, and the expandable-connector ownership lookup that runs before
//! connection-set construction. The acceptance contract this check implements
//! is stated in the [parent module docs](super) (SPEC_0008); the scope of the
//! rejection is stated below.
//!
//! ## Scope of the `EF026` rejection, and what it does not cover
//!
//! The rejection is *narrow on purpose*: it fires only for a literal
//! integer subscript applied to a declaration this phase can prove is rank-zero.
//! Everything below is a shape MLS §9.1/§10.5 also governs that this check
//! structurally cannot see or deliberately does not judge. Each is named with
//! its current behaviour and its owner so the contract is not read as a promise
//! this module does not keep (SPEC_0008).
//!
//! - **Over-subscripting a declared array** (`connect(a[1,2], b)` for `C a[2]`).
//!   Not judged here: the check accepts any non-zero declared rank, because the
//!   flat representation of a collapsed connector-array member cannot be told
//!   apart from an over-subscripted one. Current behaviour: the endpoint matches
//!   nothing, the connection contributes no equations, a duplicate flow-zero
//!   equation keeps the ED001 balance count satisfied, and the model dies later
//!   as an `E011` structural singularity. Tracked as task #82; typecheck's
//!   `ET009` (MLS §10.5.1) already implements this rule for *expression*
//!   references and is the natural owner once it walks connect arguments.
//! - **Non-literal subscripts** — `end`, `:`, and any subscript that is not an
//!   evaluated integer. These are erased upstream: `ast::QualifiedName` carries
//!   `Vec<i64>` per segment, so by the time a connection reaches this module the
//!   distinction is gone, and resolve's `ER085` skips `Subscript::Range` and
//!   treats `end` as evaluable. Current behaviour: `connect(m.u[end], s)`
//!   fabricates members on a scalar and reports `ED001` with a wrong story;
//!   `connect(m.u[2,:], s)` drops the connection entirely and dies as `E011`.
//!   Tracked as task #87; the fix belongs upstream, where the subscript form
//!   still exists.
//! - **Slices of *composite* connector arrays** (a `C u[2,3]` whose `C` has
//!   members). `find_sub_variables_indexed` drops these connections entirely
//!   (zero equations generated). Tracked as task #87. The leaf-counting fix in
//!   point 1 of the [parent module docs](super) covers *primitive* connector
//!   arrays only.
//! - **Unapplied nested redeclarations** (MLS §7.3). Instantiate applies direct
//!   component and extends replacements before expansion. Nested replacements
//!   that remain unapplied mark their affected subtree with
//!   `InstanceData::has_unapplied_redeclare`. This check abstains from treating
//!   a rank in that subtree as authoritative, while still checking unaffected
//!   siblings and replacements whose type and dimensions were applied.
