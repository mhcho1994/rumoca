//! Read-only structural presence queries over a checked [`SolveProblem`].
//!
//! These are SPEC_0029 §3 IR query helpers: they walk the problem's own
//! partitions, evaluate nothing, and reach no phase crate. They report only
//! what a checked problem *contains*.
//!
//! Admissibility is deliberately elsewhere. Deciding whether a declared target
//! capability may consume a problem that contains one of these classes is
//! backend policy and stays in `rumoca-compile`'s target-capability
//! validation; deciding whether a storage-backed FMI template may render one
//! stays in [`crate::fmi`]. Both consume the same facts from here, so a class
//! cannot be recognised by one consumer and missed by the other.
