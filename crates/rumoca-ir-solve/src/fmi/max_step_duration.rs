//! The derived maximum-step-duration local.
//!
//! MLS 3.7 §3.7.2.1 asks a variable-step integrator to respect the current
//! delay times so a delay buffer is never extrapolated. FMI has no operation
//! for that, so a delay-bearing component publishes the bound as ordinary
//! description metadata: one Rumoca-namespaced Float64 local an importer reads
//! with the standard getter it already uses for every other variable.
//!
//! Nothing about the local is supplied from outside. Its presence follows from
//! the checked kernel's delay partition, its attributes are fixed by
//! SPEC_0044 §8, and its value reference is issued by the one inventory it
//! belongs to. Because the component is the sole evaluation owner, the rows it
//! evaluates are the complete current `delay_time_rhs` partition by
//! construction, so no correlation list is stored or storable.
