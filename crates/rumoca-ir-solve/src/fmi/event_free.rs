//! The event-free type-state of the correlated codegen view.
//!
//! This view admits only components without semantic event partitions. The
//! separate [`super::FmiCCodegenView`] also admits parameter-dependent assertions
//! after proving their dependency and lifecycle requirements.
//!
//! Neither the entry shape nor the empty event domain is a property of every
//! checked component. The maximum-step-duration local of
//! [`super::max_step_duration`] is evaluated by the component rather than
//! backed by a run, and FMI forbids it a `start`; and a checked kernel may own
//! discrete/event partitions, root or scheduled events, runtime delay or
//! terminal events, or clocks that no such template describes.
//!
//! Component construction already makes the inventory shape valid: ordinary
//! entries are storage-backed, with `start` present only where FMI permits it.
//! The derived maximum-step-duration entry belongs to a delay-bearing kernel.
//! Narrowing therefore has
//! one proof to issue rather than auditing a finalized aggregate again:
//! [`super::FmiCodegenView`] is consumed into [`FmiEventFreeCodegenView`]
//! exactly when its kernel carries no semantic event class. That narrowed view
//! has a whole-inventory encoding, as does the checked C profile.
//!
//! The event domain is read through [`crate::solve_event_class`], the single
//! owner `rumoca-compile`'s target-capability gate also calls, so this
//! narrowing cannot recognise a different set of event classes than the public
//! manifest validation does.
//!
//! What is *not* proved here is stated exactly, because the type's name is a
//! claim: this narrowing says nothing about initialization owners, residual
//! algebraic systems, or the tensor/DAE-level facts a target manifest also
//! declares. Public target selection checks the complete manifest, and each
//! renderer constructor checks the capabilities required by its own templates
//! before a render context exists.
//!
//! The narrowing moves the one checked [`FmiMetadata`] and the one correlated
//! kernel handle. Nothing is copied, re-counted, or re-indexed, and the
//! unrestricted [`super::FmiCodegenView`] remains available to a future
//! event-capable renderer under ME-EVENT-002's later gate.
