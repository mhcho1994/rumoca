//! MLS §8.5 event-owner classification of `when` activation conditions.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! A `when` whose activation is a relation over `time` alone has an exactly
//! known instant, and MLS §8.5 says so: *"it is a quality of implementation
//! issue that the following special relations `time >= discrete expression`,
//! `time < discrete expression` trigger a time event at `time = discrete
//! expression`"*. Before these tests the whole activation tree was lowered as
//! zero crossings regardless, so `when time > 0.5` owned a root and no instant.
//! That is not merely inefficient. §8.5 also says *"an event generating
//! expression has an internal buffer, and the value of the expression can only
//! be changed at event instants"*, and the located crossing sits *on*
//! `t = 0.5`, where the strict relation still reads false — the crossing was
//! consumed with the activation never true, so the `when` body never ran.
//!
//! These tests pin the classification, not the numerics: the simulated
//! behaviour and its OpenModelica falsification live in
//! `crates/rumoca/tests/suite_core/time_event_when_activation.rs`.
