//! The MLS §3.7.4.5 Rule 1 / Rule 2 equation-set owner for `semiLinear`.
//!
//! §3.7.4.5 defines `semiLinear(x, positiveSlope, negativeSlope)` as
//! `smooth(0, if x >= 0 then positiveSlope*x else negativeSlope*x)` and then
//! states the defect this module owns: *"In some situations, equations with the
//! `semiLinear` function become underdetermined if the first argument (`x`)
//! becomes zero, i.e., there is an infinite number of solutions. It is
//! recommended that the following rules are used to transform the equations
//! during the translation phase in order to select one meaningful solution in
//! such cases."* Both rules rewrite a *set* of equations, so neither can live
//! in the expression lowering of one call.
//!
//! Rule 1, verbatim from §3.7.4.5, replaces
//!
//! ```text
//! y = semiLinear(x, sa, s1);
//! y = semiLinear(x, s1, s2);
//! ...
//! y = semiLinear(x, sN, sb);
//! ```
//!
//! by
//!
//! ```text
//! s1 = if x >= 0 then sa else sb;
//! s2 = s1;
//! ...
//! sN = sN-1;
//! y = semiLinear(x, sa, sb);
//! ```
//!
//! and Rule 2 replaces `x = 0; y = 0; y = semiLinear(x, sa, sb);` by
//! `x = 0; y = 0; sa = sb;`. Both keep the equation count, so the source
//! balance certificate that ran on the untransformed rows still holds.
//!
//! # Why the chain is not written that way in a connected model
//!
//! No MSL model literally writes the chain. `Modelica.Thermal.FluidHeatFlow`
//! writes one `port.H_flow = semiLinear(port.m_flow, port.h, h)` per port, and
//! the connection equations `pa.m_flow + pb.m_flow = 0`,
//! `pa.H_flow + pb.H_flow = 0`, `pa.h = pb.h` are what make two such equations
//! share one `x` and one `y`. §3.7.4.5 supplies the identity that closes the
//! gap — *"`semiLinear(m_flow, port_h, h)` is identical to
//! `-semiLinear(-m_flow, h, port_h)`"* — so an equation whose `x` and `y` are
//! both the negation of the group's is the same equation with its two slopes
//! exchanged. [`SignedAliases`] proves those `≡`/`≡ -` facts exactly, from
//! unconditional continuous equations only, and normalization applies the
//! identity. Nothing here inspects a name.
//!
//! # Acceptance contract
//!
//! A row is *recognized* when its residual is exactly `y - semiLinear(x, a, b)`
//! or `semiLinear(x, a, b) - y` with `y`, `x`, `a`, `b` all subscript-free
//! scalar variable references, and the row is lowered as an unconditional
//! continuous equation. Recognized rows are grouped by the signed alias class
//! of `(y, x)`. A group is *transformed* when
//!
//! * Rule 2: the `x` class and the `y` class are both proven identically zero;
//!   every row becomes `a - b`.
//! * Rule 1: every member carries the same `(y, x)` sign skew as the group's
//!   first member — that is, every member either states the group's canonical
//!   pair or states its exact negation, never one of the two negated alone —
//!   every slope is alias-equal (not anti-equal) to its class, and the
//!   normalized positive/negative slope pairs form one simple directed path
//!   over at least two rows.
//!
//! The skew is measured, not assumed to be zero. [`SignedAliases::opposite`]
//! reports a sign *relative to the class root*, and the `y` class and the `x`
//! class pick their roots independently (see [`SignedAliases`]), so the two
//! sign bits of one row carry an arbitrary common offset. Testing them for
//! equality would make acceptance depend on which operand a connection balance
//! happened to name first; testing them against the group's own first member
//! does not.
//!
//! Every other shape is left exactly as written. That is deliberate and is the
//! SPEC 0008 acceptance decision for this owner: §3.7.4.5 *recommends* the
//! transformation, so the untransformed equation set is conformant, and a
//! structurally identical model whose `x` never reaches zero (for example
//! `FluidHeatFlow.Examples.SimpleCooling`, whose flow is constant) simulates
//! correctly without it. Rejecting the shape would reject those models too, so
//! this owner never rejects; it transforms what it can prove.
//!
//! # What "every other shape" covers, and why that is not a gap
//!
//! The largest untransformed family is the junction of more than two ports.
//! Such a node's balance is `Ha + Hb + Hc = 0`: three live terms, which
//! [`SignedAliases`] deliberately does not read as an alias, because a
//! three-term sum proves no `≡`/`≡ -` fact about any one pair. Each `H` then
//! roots its own class, every group holds a single row, and
//! [`Chain::assemble`] rejects it for having fewer than two edges.
//!
//! This is a per-node property, not a per-model one, and no `FluidHeatFlow`
//! example is on one side of it alone. `ParallelPumpDropOut` and `TwoMass` have
//! the same mixed topology: each joins three `FlowPort`s at a node (in
//! `ParallelPumpDropOut`, `pump.flowPort_b` with `pipe1`/`pipe2.flowPort_a`),
//! and each *also* carries ordinary two-port nodes whose rows this owner does
//! chain and rewrite. A model is therefore never simply "transformed" or
//! "untransformed": its two-port chains transform and its junction rows stay as
//! written, side by side in one equation set.
//!
//! That is the honest answer rather than a missing case. §3.7.4.5 states Rule 1
//! over a *chain*: a sequence of equations that all share one `y` and one `x`,
//! whose slopes link end to end. A three-way junction shares neither — the
//! three port enthalpy flows are three different variables constrained only by
//! one sum — so the MLS supplies no rule, and there is no "one meaningful
//! solution" for this owner to select. The junction's mixing enthalpy stays
//! underdetermined at exactly zero flow, which is the defect §3.7.4.5
//! describes and only *recommends* transforming away where its rules apply.
//! rumoca therefore leaves those rows exactly as the model wrote them.
//!
//! # Events
//!
//! The relation Rule 1 writes is not given a §8.5 crossing owner. It is the
//! same `x >= 0` relation §3.7.4.5 puts inside the operator's own
//! `smooth(0, ...)`, and §3.7.5 leaves a tool free not to generate events for
//! relations inside `smooth`; rumoca already takes that freedom for the
//! operator itself, and keeps taking it for the relation the rule lifts out of
//! it. The rule is derived from those specification sections, not from any
//! other tool's implementation; OMC is cited below only as an observed second
//! opinion on a model. OMC resolves it the same way: in its output for
//! `FluidHeatFlow.Examples.PumpDropOut` the Rule 1 selectors appear as ordinary
//! equations (`tmp = GreaterEq(pipe.flowPort_a.m_flow, 0.0)` feeding
//! `pump.flowPort_b.h`), while the model's zero-crossing table lists only the
//! four `volumeFlow` ramp time events and the two `pipe.volumeFlow` friction
//! relations. Analysis therefore keys no plan on the generated relation's span,
//! and the recognizer only accepts operands that are variable references, so no
//! relation is ever discarded together with the residual it replaced.
