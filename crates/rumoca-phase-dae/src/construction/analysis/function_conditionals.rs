/// MLS §11.5 executes the statements of the first branch whose condition
/// evaluates to `true`, and the else part when none does. When the enclosing
/// value-proven specialization settles every condition it has to evaluate, that
/// choice is fixed at translation time: the selected statements are the
/// function's behaviour and the others are unreachable. MLS §12.2's rule that a
/// body is written over the inputs is what makes the choice settled — the
/// specialization exists precisely because those inputs carry proven values.
///
/// **Accepted.** The selected statements, planned as the ordinary MLS §11
/// algorithm section they are: nested loops, nested conditionals, and array
/// assemblies all keep their usual owners, because nothing about them is
/// conditional any more. This is what the "direct value assignments in every
/// checked branch" rule below cannot admit, and it does not have to: that rule
/// exists because a *runtime* branch value has no owner outside the conditional
/// expression that selects it, and a proven branch has no such expression.
///
/// **Typed-rejected.** Nothing new about the executed path. A conditional this
/// scope does not settle keeps the checked-branch rule unchanged, reported at
/// the same statement.
///
/// **Gate.** This rule reaches only a conditional whose conditions the
/// *specialization key* settles, and `ValueReadInputs` puts an input in that key
/// only when a declared dimension, compact range, or `zeros`/`ones`/`fill`
/// extent reads its value. So `f(m)` with `output Real y[m]` folds `if m == 3`
/// and `f(m)` with `output Real y[3]` does not, even though both calls pass a
/// literal. That gate is deliberate and load-bearing in two directions: it is
/// what keeps MLS §4.5 non-structural parameters — values the initialization
/// problem may establish — out of translation-time control flow, and it is what
/// bounds the specialization count so a recursive callee reaches a repeated key.
/// The cost is that an unrelated edit to a declared dimension changes whether a
/// conditional folds, which is a visible property of the language rule and not
/// an accident of this analysis.
///
/// **Not proven, and never guessed.** The statements of the branches MLS §11.5
/// does not execute contribute no value, no call, and no shape to this
/// specialization: no certificate is minted for a callee only they reach, and
/// no extent proof is demanded of them. They are *not* thereby unchecked —
/// `check_unexecuted_branches` still proves every statement well formed under
/// MLS §11.2.1, which is what the base compiler's lowering did before the fold
/// existed.
///
