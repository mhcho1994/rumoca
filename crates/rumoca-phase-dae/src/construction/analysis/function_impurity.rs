//! MLS §12.3 impure call-context proof over the exact Flat function table.
//!
//! Resolve already rejects the syntactic form of this violation, but the DAE
//! is the authority that owns executable semantics, and it resolves callees by
//! exact Flat identity rather than by name. This pass re-proves the rule where
//! it can name the callee exactly: a continuous equation, a non-initial
//! algorithm, or a pure function body may not reach an impure function.
use super::*;

/// Reject every impure call that reaches a context MLS §12.3 forbids.
///
/// The rule is stated of the written prefix — "With the prefix keyword impure
/// it is stated that a Modelica function is impure and it is only allowed to
/// call such a function from within: …" — so it is proven against
/// `Function::pure`, the written prefix. The bare external form is not proven
/// against it: MLS 3.7 §12.3 makes that form "treated as impure" for
/// transformations while stating only that it "is deprecated", so it is
/// reported (WR001) and compiled. The same section's recursive case — a
/// function treated as impure because it calls one — is a call-graph closure
/// this pass does not compute either; that is task #76.
///
/// The contexts that list permits are not visited here; the DAE owns them
/// through their own checked owners. Two of them are not reachable in this
/// compiler yet and so are not advertised by the diagnostics: `pure(…)` is
/// erased during lowering without carrying its bypass this far (task #57), and
/// an external-object binding cannot be constructed at all (ED019).
