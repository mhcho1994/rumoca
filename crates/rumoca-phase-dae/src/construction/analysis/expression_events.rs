//! MLS §8.5 event owners of model equation expressions and `when` activations.
//!
//! Appendix B keeps the event surface of `f(x)` explicit: a relation that can
//! change sign while the solver integrates owns a `relation`/root pair, a
//! relation over `time` alone owns an exactly scheduled time event, and the
//! Boolean `sample(start, interval)` operator of MLS §3.7.5 owns a periodic
//! clock. Analysis proves the owner of every such occurrence here so
//! construction only has to build the checked DAE node for it.
//!
//! Scope is every binding equation whose expression is runtime-varying, the residual of each
//! `flat::Model::equations` row, every model algorithm statement expression outside a
//! `when` body, and the activation condition of every `when`.
//! Binding expressions and residuals are the model expressions lowered exactly once, so
//! one source relation always owns exactly one checked DAE relation, and both
//! owner kinds are collected for them. Occurrence identity deduplicates a
//! binding that is also represented by an explicit residual.
//!
//! A `when` activation is different: `lower_condition_tree` already builds one
//! checked relation per relational leaf of the activation and gives each of
//! them a root, so only the *exactly scheduled* owner is collected there — see
//! [`collect_activation_time_events`]. Without that collection a `when time >
//! 0.5` would own a zero crossing instead of an instant, and §8.5 also says
//! what a relation reads between events — *"an event generating expression has
//! an internal buffer, and the value of the expression can only be changed at
//! event instants"* — so the located crossing lands exactly on `t = 0.5`, where
//! the strict relation is still false: the activation is consumed without ever
//! becoming true. Conditions of assertions keep owning their events through their
//! own semantic owners and are deliberately not collected here.
//!
//! One operator has no arm below on purpose: MLS §3.7.4.5 `semiLinear(x, kp, kn)`
//! returns `smooth(0, if x >= 0 then kp*x else kn*x)`, so the `x >= 0` relation
//! that DAE construction builds for it is already inside a `smooth`. §3.7.5
//! grants a freedom there rather than imposing a rule — *"a tool is free to not
//! generate events for expressions inside `smooth`. However, `smooth` does not
//! guarantee that no events will be generated"* — and rumoca elects to take it,
//! which is what the `Smooth` arm below encodes. The operator is C0-continuous,
//! so no crossing has to be located to keep the residual continuous, and OMC
//! emits no zero crossing for it either. Relations written inside its operands
//! are ordinary model relations and still reach their own arm through the child
//! recursion.

///
/// The instant must lie strictly after the start of the simulated interval, and
/// that bound is a semantic one rather than a convenience. §8.5 defines an event
/// as the instant at which an event generating expression *changes* its value,
/// and nothing changes at the start: initialization has already fixed every
/// relation's buffered value there, so `time >= 0` is simply true from the
/// outset with no edge to activate a `when`, and `time > 0` becomes true only
/// after the start, at the first event instant beyond it. Scheduling a stop at
/// the start instant serves neither: it is a stop at which `time > 0` still
/// reads false, and then no later event exists to retry it. Both spellings are
/// left to the zero crossing, which locates them at the start and applies them
/// at its right limit — which is where OpenModelica applies them too, stamping
/// its own right-limit row (`t = 1e-10` for `when time > 0`).
///
/// Leaving them to the crossing is what this owner decides, and it is all it
/// decides. It buys parity for `when time > 0`, which then fires once on the
/// rk-like session, exactly as OpenModelica does.
///
/// `when time >= 0` used to diverge here — rumoca fired it at `t = 0` where
/// OpenModelica leaves it unfired, because the relation is already true at the
/// start and a `when` runs on a rising edge. That was the initial-activation
/// defect (#90), and it is **fixed**: seeding the activation buffer from the
/// settled initialization values (`when` condition memory, commit 4032af2a)
/// removed the manufactured edge, so both sessions now leave `when time >= 0`
/// unfired as OpenModelica does. `crates/rumoca/tests/suite_core/time_event_when_activation.rs`
/// pins the pair.
///
/// What this bound still does not reach is the `Bdf` session, where
/// `when time > 0` does not fire at all: the located crossing at the start
/// instant is never applied there. That is a diffsol event-boundary defect
/// rather than an owner decision, and no test pins it yet.
