//! MLS §8.6 `initial algorithm` sections lowered to declarative owners.
//!
//! An initial algorithm runs once, before the trajectory exists, so its exact
//! declarative meaning is the value each written coordinate holds when
//! initialization finishes. This pass replays the section symbolically — one
//! substitution map from written coordinate to the expression that determines
//! it — and hands the result to owners that already exist:
//!
//! * an `assert` becomes a checked assertion owner with every enclosing branch
//!   condition folded into its condition, so a guarded check keeps its guard
//!   instead of becoming unconditional;
//! * a `parameter` declared `fixed = false` becomes a calculated parameter
//!   whose binding is the replayed expression. Its determining expression reads
//!   only parameters and constants. Where every one of those parameters is
//!   itself settled when the parameter set runs, the value the initialization
//!   system would compute and the value the parameter set computes are the same
//!   number — evaluating it at parameter-set time is exact, not an
//!   approximation. A `fixed = false` parameter is *not* settled then: MLS 3.6
//!   §8.6 says such a parameter is "treated as unknown during the
//!   initialization phase" and "the start-value can be used as a guess-value",
//!   so the parameter set only has that guess. A replayed expression that reads
//!   one is still accepted, and `rumoca-phase-solve`'s
//!   `lower::initial_parameters` re-applies its binding as an initialization
//!   update row after the projection that solves the unknown, which is what
//!   makes the value equivalent — the parameter-set number is then the
//!   iteration seed, not the answer;
//! * a discrete-time coordinate becomes an initialization-partition definition
//!   of the value it holds when initialization finishes. MLS §8.6 lets an
//!   initial section determine a discrete-time variable, and the equation
//!   section keeps its own owner for every later instant, so the two are
//!   different partitions rather than two owners of one coordinate.
//!
//! A zero-output call statement to a collected function is replayed the same
//! way once its body is proven to have no effect other than raising
//! assertions: the call is replaced by exactly those assertions, under the
//! same guard, so it reaches the assertion owner above. [`checking_calls`]
//! states that acceptance contract and rejects every call outside it by name.
//!
//! Every other written coordinate keeps a typed rejection: the initialization
//! system has no checked owner that solves for a state, algebraic, output, or
//! input coordinate from an algorithm, and inventing one would replace a
//! missing capability with an unproven guess.
