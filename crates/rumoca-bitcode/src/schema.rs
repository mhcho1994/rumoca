//! Rumoca Bitcode v2 — the public wire schema.
//!
//! This module is the contract external tools depend on. It is deliberately
//! **not** a mirror of any internal Rumoca type: no field here is required to
//! correspond to a Rust struct field in `rumoca-ir-dae`, and the internal
//! `DAE_SCHEMA_VERSION` may change without changing [`RBC_VERSION`].
//!
//! Rules for changing this file:
//!
//! * Adding an optional field, a new enum variant with an explicit tag, or a
//!   new collection is a **compatible** change and does not bump
//!   [`RBC_VERSION`].
//! * Removing a field, renaming a tag, or changing a field's meaning is an
//!   **incompatible** change and bumps [`RBC_VERSION`].
//! * Every enum is externally tagged by an explicit `kind` string, never by
//!   declaration order, so appending or reordering variants cannot silently
//!   change how an older file decodes.

// fields on each record rather than implied by array position, so a consumer
// never has to assume an index is an identity. They are NOT stable across two
// separate compilations; cross-artifact matching uses names, roles, and types.
