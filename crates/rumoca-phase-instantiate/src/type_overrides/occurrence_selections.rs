//! Instance-exact class selections for the member tail of a deferred reference.

//! MLS §7.3: the class of a component declared through a replaceable alias
//! (`Medium.BaseProperties medium`) is selected per occurrence, by the

//! `tank.medium.T` written outside `tank` therefore names a member whose
//! declaring class only the materialized occurrence `tank.medium` proves; the
//! class tree records no single class for the declaration.
