//! Crate dependency-tier edge enforcement for the solve/runtime stack.
//!
//! Policy: SPEC_0029 §"Dependency Tiers" ("dependencies flow downward") and
//! §3b ("Runtime Policy Ownership"). `rumoca-eval-solve` is a Tier 3 crate: it
//! is a pure Solve-IR row evaluator / scalarizer. Component-private evaluation
//! (`SolveRuntime`) lives in `rumoca-solver::runtime`; the sole master driver
//! and session live in `rumoca-solver::fmi_me`.
//!
//! Before this module existed, `rumoca-eval-solve` depended *upward* on
//! `rumoca-solver` and hosted the driver, which even hard-coded the diffsol
//! backend's tracing namespace. These tests pin the corrected layering so the
//! edge cannot silently come back.
