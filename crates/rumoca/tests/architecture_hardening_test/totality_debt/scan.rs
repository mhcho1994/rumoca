//! Line-oriented scan for totality-debt call forms in production Rust source.
//!
//! The scan never parses Rust. It strips comment text, string literals and
//! character literals from each line, walks the stripped lines tracking whether
//! a line belongs to a `#[cfg(test)]` item, and counts the call forms whose
//! totality argument is carried by a message string rather than by a type.
//!
//! Block comments and string literals span lines, so the stripper carries which
//! one a line ended inside into the next line. Without that carry, the body of a
//! multi-line literal reads as code, and one unbalanced brace in it moves the
//! item state machine off the real structure of the file. That failure is silent
//! in the dangerous direction: it drops shipped lines from the count and leaves
//! no trace at the end of the file for the tracking assertion to catch.
//!
//! Both directions of the remaining imprecision are deliberate and safe for a
//! count-may-only-fall gate:
//!
//! * Failing to recognise a test-only construct counts test code as production,
//!   which raises the count and trips the gate. An author sees it immediately.
//! * A `#[cfg(test)]` item is genuinely absent from a release build, so removing
//!   it from the count hides no shipped obligation.
