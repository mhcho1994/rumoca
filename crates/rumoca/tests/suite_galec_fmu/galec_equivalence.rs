//! GALEC three-leg differential-execution harness (SPEC_0034 GAL-027/GAL-038).
// SPEC_0021 file-size exception: the three-leg harness and its fixture catalog
// remain together to share one checked package. split plan: move model fixture
// definitions and CSV comparison helpers into dedicated test support modules.
//!
//! Every fixture is executed three independent ways and all three are compared
//! tick-for-tick:
//!
//! 1. **Generated C.** The `embedded-c-galec` artifacts are rendered
//!    in-process from the fixture's projected package; the generated C is
//!    compiled (`cc -Wall -Werror`), linked (`-lm`), and run through a
//!    per-fixture driver that prints every compared block output plus the
//!    eFMI `ErrorSignalStatus` as one CSV line after `startup`, after
//!    `recalibrate`, and per `dostep` tick.
//! 2. **The `rumoca-eval-galec` oracle.** The checked `AlgorithmCodePackage`
//!    the C template renders (`target.toml` declares `ir =
//!    "algorithm-code"`) is interpreted in-process over the same
//!    `Startup`/`Recalibrate`/`DoStep` schedule. This is the independent
//!    proof oracle GAL-027 requires; without a consumer it never ran, and a
//!    C-vs-reference comparison alone is self-confirming for any defect the
//!    projection and the template share.
//! 3. **The Modelica reference.** The fixture is simulated in-process by
//!    Rumoca's own solver (`rumoca_sim::simulate_dae`) — checked source
//!    semantics — and read at the aligned sample time.
//!
//! **One projection, one shared object (be precise about what leg 2 proves).**
//! Each test lowers its fixture exactly once ([`project_embedded_c`]) and
//! keeps the resulting [`AlgorithmCodePackage`] alive. The C that leg 1
//! compiles is rendered from *that* package handle, through the same
//! `AlgorithmCodeTemplateRenderer` + `[[files]]` walk `rumoca`'s
//! `render_target_files` drives for an `ir = "algorithm-code"` target; leg 2's
//! `Evaluator` is built from the very same package's checked block. A
//! C-vs-oracle divergence is therefore a divergence between the template's C
//! and explicit GALEC semantics over one shared object, and can never be an
//! artifact of two independent lowerings.
//!
//! **The CLI is a separate plumbing smoke.** Because the executing legs no
//! longer run the CLI, every fixture additionally runs `rumoca compile
//! --target embedded-c-galec` once in a child process and byte-compares each
//! emitted file against the in-process render
//! ([`assert_cli_emits_the_rendered_bytes`]); a mismatch fails with a diff
//! excerpt. That equality is what carries the differential result over to the
//! shipped path: it proves the CLI's projection → renderer plumbing produced
//! exactly the artifact the two executing legs were compared on. It is a
//! byte comparison and nothing more — CLI behaviour *after* the write
//! (packaging, completion messages, exit-code policy, diagnostics) is
//! `cli_target_embedded_c_galec`'s job, not this harness's.
//!
//! **Alignment (empirically grounded against `simulate_dae`).** The block
//! life-cycle is `startup` (seeds state) then one `dostep` per fixed sample
//! tick. Both executing legs are compared after `startup` and after
//! `recalibrate` as well, so a seeding or re-tuning divergence cannot hide in
//! the un-observed prologue. For `when sample(t0, period)` the first tick
//! fires *at* `t0`
//! (verified: `sample(0.0, 0.1)` makes `count = 1` at `t = 0`), so the
//! j-th `dostep` (j = 1..N) corresponds to the sample at `t_j = t0 +
//! (j-1)*period`. The reference is read at the strictly-interior hold-
//! interval midpoint `t0 + (j-1)*period + period/2` via a right-continuous
//! hold, so both sides carry the post-tick value regardless of where the
//! solver plants event rows. The startup seed is never compared against the
//! reference (for a `t0 = 0` model no reference row equals it).
//!
//! `cc` is a hard dependency: a missing compiler FAILS, never skips
//! (SPEC_0034 GAL-012). The generated condition vector `c[1]` is
//! projection-internal and absent from the emitted C, so it is never
//! compared — only manifest outputs/states that exist as C struct fields.
//!
//! **Signal/error channel.** Every driver row ends with
//! `self->rumoca_galec_error_signal_status`, and the oracle's
//! `active_signals()` set is folded into that same bit encoding, so the
//! §3.2.5 signal machinery is compared on every fixture and every lifecycle
//! observation — not only on the fixture that raises one
//! (`embedded_c_nan_comparison_signals_match_the_galec_oracle`). This channel
//! exists on the two executing legs only: `simulate_dae` has no
//! `ErrorSignalStatus`, so the reference leg is compared on values alone and
//! is never evidence about signals.
//!
//! Fixtures here are original works authored for the Rumoca test suite; no
//! third-party Modelica sources (e.g. the Modelica Standard Library) are
//! copied. The IIR difference equation `y[k] = a*y[k-1] + b*u[k]` is a
//! standard textbook form, not copyrightable content.

/// and they are compared over different leg sets: the branch every leg must
/// take — GALEC comparisons yield `false` on a NaN operand, so `y` is the

// SPEC_0042 T3 ("implicit `limit self` at method entry/return; Startup:
// return only") is the settled semantics: a GALEC declared range is a
// saturation, not a Modelica assertion, and it leaves a qNaN as a qNaN.
// `rumoca-eval-galec` is the normative oracle — `interpreter.rs::invoke`
// calls `limit_all()` on entry when `limit_at_entry` and again on return,
// and `execution.rs::limit_all` -> `limit_declaration_value` ->
// `runtime.rs::limit_value` applies the declared bounds to every state slot,
// arrays elementwise, low bound before high bound.
//
// This fixture was previously recorded here as a KNOWN, UNLANDED two-leg
// divergence: the C template emitted no clamp anywhere, so it reported
// 1,2,3,4,5 against the oracle's 1,2,2,2,2. `embedded-c-galec/model.c.jinja`
// now emits `rumoca_galec_limit_self` and calls it at exactly those
// boundaries, so the fixture is landed as a gate. The `statements` macro
// still has no `limit` arm: an *explicit* GALEC `limit` statement is a
// different construct that T3 does not cover, and it keeps failing closed.
//
// **The reference leg is deliberately not a value oracle for `ySat`.**
// Modelica's `min`/`max` are declaration attributes with no saturating
// semantics, so `simulate_dae` never clamps: it tracks `count` unbounded. That
// is not a defect on either side — it is the exact difference T3 records
// ("opposite of Modelica semantics") — so `ySat` is gated as oracle == C ==
// closed-form via [`assert_executing_legs_agree`] plus
// [`LIMIT_SMOKE_SATURATED`], and its reference values are never compared
// rather than being loosened into agreement. What the reference leg IS used
// for here is the negative direction: its `ySat` must still run past the
// declared max, so "all legs agree" can never come from the clamp having
// quietly become a no-op. `count` carries no range and stays a full three-leg
// channel, so the tick schedule itself is still referenced.
//
// Recorded so the numbers are not rediscovered: at the harness's aligned
// sample points the reference reports `ySat` = 0,1,2,3,4 against the executing
// legs' 1,2,2,2,2. Both the missing clamp AND a one-tick lag are visible in
// that row — `ySat := count` is assigned in the same `when` body as `count`,
// yet the reference publishes it one sample late. The lag is a reference-leg
// defect independent of T3 (it shows on every fixture in this file that
// assigns a discrete Real inside the `when`), which is a second reason this
// channel is not compared against `simulate_dae`. Promote `ySat` to a
// three-leg value channel once the reference both saturates and aligns.

// exactly the ticks that branch is selected.
//
// `echoLow`, `echoHigh` and `echoSpan` read variables the `if` statement above
// them assigns, so the checked DAE gives each of them a conditional value whose
// selected branch projects one result of `signallingSplit`. Nothing about that
// conditional is an activation guard: it is an ordinary expression the value
// carries, and its branch is what decides whether the call runs. Sharing it is
// only legal under that branch condition, and the function raises NAN on every
// call, so the compared `ErrorSignalStatus` word is a per-tick record of the
// ticks it ran on. The branch is not selected on ticks 1 and 2, so an
// evaluation hoisted out of it would raise NAN there and both executing legs
// would disagree with the pinned expectation below.
//
// The fixture also carries fixture 15's shape, because the `if` statement that
// creates the conditional is itself the activation of the three assignments
// inside it. Both nodes stand under the same predicate, so the compared word
// pins them together.

// ===========================================================================
// Fixture 17: one shared-call node never reads another shared-call node's
// result temporary before that node has written it.
//
// A node is built from the memo the earlier nodes left, so a nested call in a
// later node's own argument tree can take an earlier node's temporary. That is
// a schedule edge, and if it is not declared the greedy worklist is free to
// emit the later node first. This model makes exactly that order tempting:
// `outr(ia)` sits inside the `if`, `ia` comes from `innr(n)` which is shared at
// domain entry, and `alt(v)` reads a `v` the `if` writes, so the entry node
// cannot be emitted first unless the guarded node already ran.
//
// The failure mode is silent, which is why this is pinned by value. Reading the
// stale slot leaves the previous tick's number in it, so `g1` reads 40 instead
// of 60 on the tick the branch first fires: a plausible one-tick lag, not
// obvious garbage.
//
// **Two executing legs, and a closed form that shares nothing with them.** The
// trap needs a node whose arguments are rewritten later in the same tick, and
// `simulate_dae` refuses exactly that as a same-tick discrete loop (EL005), the
// pre-existing limitation the corpus pin already records for
// `flight/waypoint-mission`. So the reference leg cannot run here and this
// fixture is gated on the two executing legs, as `LimitSmoke` is. That is not a
// weaker guard against the defect it exists for: both executing legs read the
// same slot and would agree with each other, so what catches a stale read is
// the hand-computed closed form below, which shares no code with either leg,
// and the strict compile, which reports the read as a definite-assignment
// defect whatever number the slot happens to hold.

// so the read-back copy is never generated
// (`views::algorithm_code_typed::destination`). The whole risk of that is
// aliasing: the callee writes the destination WHILE its own body runs, so an
// operand that shares storage with the destination would stop seeing its
// pre-call value.
//
// `stage` calls two identical blends. `mixed := blendA(hold)` writes a slot no
// operand names and is the placement's own case. `hold := blendB(hold)` assigns
// its result back over the very argument it read, which the permission refuses,
// and both bodies read `u[1]` on every iteration AFTER writing `y[1]` on the
// first — so a placement taken there would feed the second and third elements a
// value the model never computes. The two channels differ in exactly that way,
// which is what makes this fixture evidence rather than a smoke test.
