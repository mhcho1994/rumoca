//! Umbrella binary for GALEC-family integration suites. The compiler and
//! differential-execution checks run without optional features; the eFMU
//! container members are enabled only by `fmu-packaging`.
//!
//! Both container members define identically named tests (they pin the same container
//! invariants for the Algorithm Code and Production Code tracks); the module
//! prefix keeps the two sets distinct inside the shared binary.
