//! The finite-difference battery, generated from the admission table.
//!
//! The Jacobian synthesis specification states what synthesis does with every
//! construct at every shape of operands, and `rumoca_phase_autodiff::admission`
//! is that statement as data. This gate reads it and writes the probes: an
//! admitted pair gets a
//! probe whose synthesized Jacobian is compared against central differences, a
//! refused pair gets a probe whose refusal must fire in the compiler *and* in
//! `--emit-standard-modelica` citing the same rule, and a pair that is not a
//! Modelica program gets a probe proving the engine is never asked for it.
//!
//! The point of generating the battery rather than writing it is that a
//! construct cannot be admitted quietly. It either has a row here, and then it
//! has a finite-difference check, or it has no row, and then
//! `every_construct_the_engine_reaches_is_stated_exactly_once` fails in the
//! crate that owns the rules. There is no third state, which is what the
//! specification's dichotomy asks for.
//!
//! Each probe carries its result out component by component, never reduced, so
//! nothing between the construct and the Jacobian can absorb a rank a wrong
//! tangent collapsed.
