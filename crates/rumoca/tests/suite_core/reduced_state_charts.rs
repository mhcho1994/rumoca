//! SPEC_0053 section 2a: the reduced state selection issues a bounded set of
//! admissible reconstruction charts for a folding definitional first-integral
//! coordinate group, carried inertly on the continuous solve system.
//!
//! A conserved holonomic norm `g = x*x - 1` has no globally injective reduced
//! chart: its gradient `g_d = 2*x_i` vanishes as `x_i` passes through zero, so a
//! fixed reduced basis folds. The compiler enumerates one admissible
//! reconstruction chart per source scalar of the group, keeping the primary
//! (regular at the trial point) as chart zero and its mirror alongside, and maps
//! each to the real lowered shape: a separate scalar algebraic block plus the
//! generated `$state_coordinates`. Stage 1 only records the set; it changes no
//! primary basis and no trajectory.

/// quarter turn and completes on the physical branch, matching the analytic
/// unit circle rather than the mirror root a fixed reduced basis folds onto.
///
/// The interior trace points are event-left observations the recorder captures
/// by saving the component FMU state at each accepted step and restoring it to
/// observe the left limit. Because those saved states span the chart switches
/// (the active chart index and its runtime), the analytic match of the whole
/// trace is also the get/set-FMU-state round-trip evidence: a save and restore
/// across a basis change preserves every observable.
