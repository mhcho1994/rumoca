//! When a `when` activation fires: the §8.5 instant it owns, the §8.3.5.1 edge
//! that runs its body, and the §8.3.5 priority between the branches of a chain.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! `when time > 0.5 then ...` did not fire. Not late, not twice — never.
//!
//! MLS 3.6 §8.5 calls the schedule out by name: *"It is a quality of
//! implementation issue that the following special relations `time >= discrete
//! expression`, `time < discrete expression` trigger a time event at
//! `time = discrete expression`"*. rumoca took that freedom for a relation
//! written in a model equation but not for one written as a `when` activation:
//! `lower_condition_tree` gave every relational leaf of an activation a zero
//! crossing, so the instant `t = 0.5` was searched for instead of scheduled.
//!
//! Searching for it is what broke it. §8.5 also fixes what a relation reads
//! between events — *"An event generating expression has an internal buffer, and
//! the value of the expression can only be changed at event instants"*, and
//! *"during continuous integration event generation expression has the constant
//! value of the expression from the last event instant"* — and the located
//! crossing lands **on** `t = 0.5`, where the strict relation still reads false.
//! The crossing was therefore consumed with the activation never true, and no
//! later crossing existed to retry it.
//!
//! Whether the bug was visible depended on details with no semantic content —
//! which solver path the model took, and whether the located crossing happened
//! to coincide with an output sample. The superseded backend applied a
//! coincident crossing *at* that sample, where the strict relation still reads
//! false, but applied a non-coincident one at the sample's right limit, where
//! it finally reads true. `when time > 0.5` on its own escaped;
//! `when time > 0.5 and x < 2` — the same relation, one extra conjunct — never
//! fired at all, on either solver.
//!
//! # OpenModelica falsification
//!
//! Every expectation below was first run through `omc` (dassl, `stopTime=1.0`,
//! `numberOfIntervals=20`), which emits three rows at an event instant:
//! pre-event, event-left, event-right. The `t = 0.5` column below is that
//! triple.
//!
//! | model                              | omc `t = 0.45` | omc `t = 0.5` | omc `t = 0.55` |
//! | ---------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
//! | `when time > 0.5 then y = 1`       | 0              | 0, 0, 1       | 1              |
//! | `when time >= 0.5 then y = 1`      | 0              | 0, 0, 1       | 1              |
//! | `when time > 0.5 and x < 2`        | 0              | 0, 0, 1       | 1              |
//! | `when x < 2 and time > 0.5`        | 0              | 0, 0, 1       | 1              |
//! | `when time > 2 * p`, `p = 0.25`    | 0              | 0, 0, 1       | 1              |
//! | `when time > 0.5 then reinit(x,1)` | 0              | 0, 0, 1       | 1              |
//! | `when time < 0.5 then y = 1`       | 0              | 0, 0, 0       | 0              |
//! | `when {initial(), time > 0.5}`     | 1              | 1, 1, 2       | 2              |
//!
//! Two further OpenModelica runs back the multi-instance and start-instant
//! expectations below. A class instantiated as `early(threshold = 0.33)` and
//! `late(threshold = 0.73)` fires `early.y` at `0.33` and `late.y` at `0.73`
//! (array instantiation `t[2](threshold = {0.33, 0.73})` gives the same two
//! instants), and `when time > 0` fires once at the start's right limit while
//! `when time >= 0` never fires at all.
//!
//! The falling row is the one that says strictness is not the axis: `time < 0.5`
//! owns the very same instant, and the body still does not run there, because a
//! `when` activates on a rising edge only.
//!
//! One presentational difference remains and is asserted around rather than
//! away. Both tools apply the activation at the event's *right limit* — where
//! §8.5's buffered relation first reads true — and both stamp the row with that
//! right limit rather than with the instant; they differ only in how wide the
//! limit is. OpenModelica's is about 4e-10 relative (`0.3300000001330113` for an
//! instant at `0.33`, `1.000000000124e-10` for one at `0`); rumoca's is
//! `2 * atol`, i.e. `0.500002` for `t = 0.5` at the default `atol = 1e-6`. The
//! values agree; the stamps differ by 2e-6 out of a 0.05 output interval.
//!
//! # Activation at the initial instant
//!
//! MLS §8.6: *"The equations of a when-clause are active during initialization,
//! if and only if they are explicitly enabled with `initial()`"*, in one of the
//! two forms `when initial() then` or `when {…, initial(), …} then`. Everything
//! else must have a rising edge to run, and §8.3.5.1 says where the edge comes
//! from: a `when` is conceptually
//!
//! ```text
//! Boolean b(start = x.start > 2);
//! b  = x > 2;
//! v1 = if edge(b) then expr1 else pre(v1);
//! ```
//!
//! — the activation buffer *starts at the condition's own value*, and §8.6's
//! *"Before the start of the integration, it must be guaranteed that for all
//! variables `v`, `v = pre(v)`"* keeps `pre(b) = b` there. A condition already
//! true at `t = 0` therefore has no edge at the initial event, and one that is
//! true at `t = 0` and only ever falls has no edge for the whole run.
//!
//! rumoca left that buffer at `false`, which manufactured an edge at the initial
//! event for every already-true activation, on both solver paths. The buffer is
//! now seeded from the settled initialization values, with the `initial()` flag
//! cleared — `initial()` is false everywhere except the initial event, so it is
//! the one activation that keeps its edge there.
//!
//! | model                                    | omc | rumoca before          | rumoca after |
//! | ---------------------------------------- | --- | ---------------------- | ------------ |
//! | `when time < 0.5 then y = 1`             | 0   | 1 at `t = 0` (bdf)     | 0            |
//! | `when x < 2 then y = 1`, `der(x) = 1`    | 0   | 1 at `t = 0` (bdf)     | 0            |
//! | `when time < 0.5 and x < 2 then y = 1`   | 0   | 1 at `t = 0` (bdf)     | 0            |
//! | the two above, beside a `when initial()` | 0   | 1 at `t = 0` (both)    | 0            |
//! | `when not (time > 0.5) then y = 1`       | 0   | 1 from `t = 0.5` (rk)  | 0            |
//! | `when initial() then y = 1`              | 1   | 1                      | 1            |
//! | `when {initial(), time > 0.5}`           | 1→2 | 1→2                    | 1→2          |
//!
//! The `when initial()` row in that table is what makes the rest safe to read:
//! the seed removes spurious activations without removing the §8.6 one. The
//! `and`/`beside a when initial()` rows are what identify the defect as *one*
//! bug rather than two: before the fix the rk-like session happened to agree on
//! the first two models only because they own no initial event at all, and
//! adding a `when initial()` — which creates one — made it disagree exactly as
//! the diffsol session did.
//!
//! # Vector activations: one buffer per element
//!
//! §8.3.5 activates on *"any of the elements … becomes true"*, and §8.3.5.1
//! realises that as one `Boolean bi` per element with the activation
//! `edge(b1) or … or edge(bn)`. That is not the edge of the disjunction, and
//! `omc` is where the difference is visible rather than merely arguable:
//!
//! | model                              | omc                     |
//! | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
//! | `when {true, time > 0.5}`          | fires at `t = 0.5`      |
//! | `when true or time > 0.5`          | never fires             |
//! | `when {u, not u}`, `u = time > 0.3`| fires at `t = 0.3`      |
//! | `when u or not u`                  | never fires             |
//!
//! rumoca folded a vector into one `Or` with one buffer, which makes the two
//! rows of each pair indistinguishable — and once the buffer is seeded, a
//! tautological disjunction seeds *true* and the activation is deleted outright.
//!
//! Three MSL blocks are written in that shape:
//! `Modelica.Blocks.Logical.TriggeredTrapezoid` and `LogicalDelay`
//! (`when {u, not u}`), and `Modelica.Blocks.Math.ContinuousSignalExtrema`
//! (`when {u <= x, u >= x, terminal()}`). **None of the three compiles in rumoca
//! today**, for reasons unrelated to activation — `initial()` inside an
//! expression and `terminal()` (ED018), `pre` of a continuous variable (ED019),
//! and an initialization-projection failure — so no claim is made here about
//! what they do. They are the reason the shape matters, not evidence about it.
//! The evidence is the OpenModelica table above and the tests below, measured on
//! the shape itself.
//!
//! # `when <literal>` is a `when`
//!
//! A constant activation still has an activation buffer. §8.3.5.1 starts it at
//! the condition's own value and §8.6 holds `pre(b) = b` before integration, so
//! `when true then` never has a rising edge and never runs — `omc` leaves
//! `y = 0` for `when true then y = pre(y) + 1`, and the same for a
//! `parameter Boolean b = true`. What must *not* carry a buffer is the
//! activation rumoca synthesises for an unguarded algorithm section and for a
//! section-level `assert`, neither of which is a `when` at all; those are a
//! distinct DAE node (`ConditionOperation::Always`) rather than a literal, so
//! the two can no longer be confused by shape.
//!
//! # Divergences these tests deliberately do not claim
//!
//! Two of the five below are regressions this line of work introduced and chose
//! to land; the rest were there before it and are untouched. Each says which it
//! is, because a recorded divergence that misdescribes its own origin is worse
//! than an unrecorded one.
//!
//! * **Two branches of one chain whose instants coincide — REGRESSION
//!   INTRODUCED HERE.** `when time > 0.5 then y = 1; elsewhen x > 0.5 then
//!   y = 2;` with `der(x) = 1`. Both conditions become true at `t = 0.5`, and
//!   `omc` handles them in one event iteration, where §8.3.5's branch priority
//!   picks the first: `y = 1` for the rest of the run. On the rk-like session the
//!   first branch is a *scheduled instant* and the second a *located crossing*,
//!   and the two land in different event iterations — so the second branch finds
//!   its own edge at an instant where the first no longer has one, and `y` steps
//!   to `2` at the next output sample. Before the branch guards were corrected,
//!   the level subtraction masked this: `not (time > 0.5)` was false, so the
//!   second branch was suppressed and `y` stayed `1` by accident. **`y` regressed
//!   from 1 to 2 relative to the pre-change tree** on this shape. The cause is
//!   the iteration split, not the guard — `omc` reaches the same answer as
//!   rumoca whenever the two instants really are distinct — and it is the same
//!   rk-like defect as the record below. The diffsol session leaves `y = 0` here,
//!   before and after.
//! * **A scheduled instant coinciding with a state crossing — REGRESSION
//!   INTRODUCED EARLIER, same rk-like cause.** `when time > 0.5 then a = 1` beside
//!   `when x > 0.5 then b = pre(a) + 10`, with `der(x) = 1`. `omc` handles both
//!   in one event iteration at the instant, so `b = 10` with `pre(a) = 0`, as
//!   §8.5 requires. Before this change rumoca also reached `b = 10`, one output
//!   interval late, because both activations were zero crossings and the
//!   rk-like session located them together. Giving the `time` relation a
//!   scheduled instant splits them into two iterations, and the second one now
//!   reads a `pre(a)` the first has already advanced: **`b` regressed from 10 to
//!   11 relative to the pre-change tree.** The regression was measured and
//!   accepted rather than overlooked — no MSL `when` gains a scheduled instant
//!   (every `time`-relational activation in the library has a threshold
//!   `time_event_instant` rejects), the trigger needs a state crossing to land
//!   exactly on an instant, and five other probes moved from wrong to
//!   OpenModelica-matching — but it is a regression and is recorded as one.
//!
//!   The fix belongs to the rk-like session, which applies a scheduled right
//!   limit without carrying the continuous state across it, so a crossing that
//!   lands on the instant is not yet true when the instant is handled. The
//!   equivalent carry *is* in place on the backend-neutral driver kernel that
//!   the diffsol session uses; that does not rescue this model, because on
//!   `SimSolverMode::Bdf` neither `a` nor `b` fires at all, before or after this
//!   change — a separate, pre-existing diffsol defect.
//! * **The diffsol session and a located state crossing** (pre-existing). On
//!   `SimSolverMode::Bdf` a crossing over a continuous state is located far from
//!   where `omc` puts it: `when x > 0.3 then y = 1` with `der(x) = 1` first
//!   reads `y = 1` at `t = 0.7` rather than `0.3`, and the second branch of a
//!   chain over the same state never arrives inside a `[0, 1]` run. Measured
//!   identical before and after this change, so it is that session's root
//!   location and not the activation semantics; this file therefore names its
//!   solver mode explicitly rather than asserting whatever the default happens
//!   to be. [`the_diffsol_session_agrees_on_a_scheduled_instant`] pins the part
//!   of that session the schedule *does* reach.
//! * **A scalar `initial()` inside a larger condition enables the whole
//!   condition** (pre-existing). MLS §8.6 enables a when-clause during
//!   initialization in exactly two spellings, `when initial() then` and
//!   `when {…, initial(), …} then`; `omc` honours that and does not enable
//!   `when initial() or time > 0.5`, nor `when not initial()`. rumoca treats any
//!   condition containing `initial()` as enabling. The vector spelling is
//!   correct (see [`initial_alternative_in_a_vector_activation_keeps_both_owners`]
//!   and [`an_initial_element_does_not_enable_an_already_true_element`]); the
//!   scalar one is a separate §8.6 admissibility question and no test below
//!   asserts it.
//! * **A `when` body reading a variable the same body assigns — SPEC VIOLATION**
//!   (pre-existing). MLS §8.3.5.1 expands a `when` body to *simultaneous
//!   equations*, one `v = if edge(b) then expr else pre(v)` per assigned
//!   variable. They are equations, not statements, so a body that reads `a`
//!   after assigning it must see the **new** `a`. rumoca evaluates the rows of
//!   an event pass sequentially against the event-entry snapshot, so it sees the
//!   old one.
//!
//!   ```modelica
//!   when time > 0.5 then
//!     a = pre(a) + 1;
//!     b = if a > pre(a) then 100 else -100;
//!   end when;
//!   ```
//!
//!   `omc` gives `b = 100`; rumoca gives `b = -100`, on both solver sessions and
//!   both before and after this change (`a` itself is correct in all four). The
//!   same defect in its cross-`when` form is `when pre(b) then …` beside
//!   `when time > 0.7 then b = false;`, where the two `when`s disagree about
//!   which `b` the instant `t = 0.7` sees.
//!
//!   This is a §8.3.5.1 violation rather than a presentation difference, and it
//!   is the whole of what still separates rumoca from `omc` on
//!   `Modelica.Blocks.Math.ContinuousSignalExtrema`'s shape: its `t_min`/`t_max`
//!   bodies are `if y_min < pre(y_min) then time else pre(t_min)`, read after
//!   `y_min` is assigned in the same body, and they stay at their start values
//!   for exactly this reason. Its `y_min`/`y_max` — which read nothing the body
//!   assigns — track `omc` exactly. Fixing it is a separate change to
//!   event-pass row scheduling; no test below asserts the violated shape.
//! * **A `discrete Boolean` assigned by a relation equation** (pre-existing, and
//!   not about `when` at all). `discrete Boolean b; b = time < 0.5; when b then
//!   y = 1;` — `omc` gives `b = 1` until `t = 0.5` and `0` after. rumoca never
//!   updates `b` at all on the rk-like session (`b = 0` throughout) and pins it
//!   at `1` for the whole run on the diffsol one. Both `y` traces follow from
//!   `b`, so nothing here can be read as an activation claim, and no test below
//!   asserts this shape.
