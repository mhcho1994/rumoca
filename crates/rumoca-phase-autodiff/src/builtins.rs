//! Tangent rules for builtin operators.
//!
//! Three sets partition the builtins this engine meets: operators with a
//! tangent rule, operators whose result cannot move with a change of a Real
//! input, and operators that are stated non-differentiable and refuse. A name in none
//! of the three is not a builtin at all and is looked up as a function.
//!
//! **Shape of the rule text (JAC-T2).** A rule that joins two terms whose
//! shapes the call does not have to match writes the join elementwise. Every
//! `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` that survives below joins operands of provably equal
//! rank: `log(10.0)*v` and `2.0*sqrt(v)` are a scalar spread over one array
//! (MLS 10.6.3), and `cross`/`outerProduct` join two rank-1 and two rank-2
//! results. `atan2` is the rule whose operands may differ in rank, so both its
//! sum and its difference are elementwise.
