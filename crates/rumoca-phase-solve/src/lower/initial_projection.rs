//! Which coordinates the MLS 3.6 §8.6 initialization system solves, and which
//! rows solve them.
//!
//! MLS 3.6 §8.6: "Before any operation is carried out with a Modelica model
//! (e.g., simulation or linearization), initialization takes place to assign
//! consistent values for all variables present in the model. During this phase,
//! also the derivatives `der(...)` and the pre-variables […] are interpreted as
//! unknown algebraic variables. The initialization uses all equations and
//! algorithms that are utilized in the intended operation."
//!
//! ## The unknowns/equations accounting rule
//!
//! The system MLS states is over *every* coordinate at once. This phase solves
//! the reduced form of it, which is exact because the reduction is by
//! substitution rather than by dropping rows:
//!
//! * **`der(x)` is not a free unknown here.** The structural matching already
//!   named the continuous row that determines each state derivative, and the
//!   Solve lowering replaces every `der(x)` an initialization row reads by that
//!   row's right-hand side (`ScalarCompiler::derivative_value`). So the
//!   der-equations are *active* at the initial instant — exactly the §8.6
//!   reading — but they are folded into the rows that read them instead of
//!   standing as extra rows over extra unknowns. `initial equation der(x) = 0`
//!   is therefore a row over `x`, not over `der(x)`.
//! * **A `fixed = true` start determines its state.** A source start proved
//!   independent of initialization unknowns supplies a given coordinate that
//!   projection cannot write. A start that depends on an unknown parameter is
//!   only a seed until its `state = startExpression` residual joins the same
//!   projection as the initial equations and retained manifold.
//! * **A start with `fixed = false`, or with no `fixed` at all, is a guess.**
//!   MLS 3.6 §4.8.1 gives `fixed` the default `false` for everything that is
//!   not a parameter or constant, and §8.6 says of such a start only that "the
//!   start value is used as a guess value". So a state's seed is an iteration
//!   guess and the initialization equations are what determine it.
//! * **A `fixed = false` parameter is an unknown** (§8.6: "All variables
//!   declared as parameter having `fixed = false` are treated as unknowns during
//!   the initialization phase, i.e., there must be additional equations for
//!   them"). `initial_parameters` owns that half and its binding-substitution
//!   ordering; this module only reads the coordinates it published.
//!
//! The resulting unknowns are states without given values and unbound
//! `fixed = false` parameters. Dependent fixed starts and transferred pins
//! remain explicit equations, alongside initial equations and every retained
//! manifold row.
//! A rectangular system keeps its surplus equations as consistency checks;
//! a free state without a determining equation retains its start guess.
//!
//! ## What is deliberately not an unknown, and what that costs
//!
//! A row reaching a coordinate outside that space is left unplanned. It stays in
//! the residual block, so the complete-residual test at the end of the projection
//! still evaluates it — but *what that evaluation proves* differs by kind, and
//! [`solve::InitializationRowRole`] carries the difference to the runtime so a
//! failure names the right defect instead of the friendliest one.
//!
//! **Algebraic and output reads follow the continuous matching.** Each read
//! expands its matched source row, including the exact tensor component and
//! structured domain point. A visited-coordinate set closes algebraic cycles;
//! their external state and parameter dependencies determine the reduced
//! projection incidence. The runtime reconstructs algebraics at each residual
//! evaluation and differentiates that complete map. Stored algebraic seeds
//! cannot certify initialization, and a missing defining row remains unowned.
//!
//! **Discrete reads: the check is honest, and the refusal is an over-refusal.** A
//! discrete coordinate *is* at its §8.6 value when the residual runs — the runtime
//! seeds and settles the discrete values before `settle_initialization_system`. So
//! the row checks a real number; it simply has no way to solve for the state it
//! also reads. `x + q = 5; x = d + 2;` with `d(start = 0, fixed = true)` is
//! satisfiable at `x = 2, q = 3`, which is what OpenModelica returns, and rumoca
//! reports `EX001` instead. That is an over-refusal against OMC, not merely an
//! unplanned row, and admitting it needs discretes in the unknown space's
//! *determined* half — task #44's event-machinery territory.
//!
//! **Array coordinates retain their exact scalar identity.** Initial equations,
//! structured family points, substituted parameter bindings, and matched
//! derivative rows use the same checked scalar dependency projection as
//! structural incidence. A projection failure remains unowned. A fixed state
//! declaration or transferred pin contributes only its actual scalar equations.
//!
//! ## Two choices this phase makes that the model does not
//!
//! **Which under-determined state keeps its guess.** For `x + y = 5` over two
//! guessed states, one equation cannot fix two coordinates. OpenModelica warns
//! ("The initial conditions are not fully specified") and keeps `x`, solving
//! `y = 5`; this planner takes the first augmenting assignment in solver-slot
//! order and keeps `y`, solving `x = 2`. Nothing in §8.6 picks between them,
//! because the model states nothing about it. The choice is pinned by
//! `an_under_determined_state_component_keeps_the_remaining_start_guesses` so it
//! stays a recorded fact rather than drift.
//!
//! **Which root of a nonlinear initialization block.** §8.6 says the `start` value
//! "is used as a guess value", and Newton from that guess converges to whichever
//! root it is nearest: `q*q = 4` from `start = 3` gives `q = 2`, from `start = -3`
//! it gives `q = -2`. Both satisfy the model, both are legal §8.6 answers, and the
//! declared `start` is the only thing that decides — so a model that cares must
//! say so with its `start`, and a comparison against another tool is a comparison
//! of guesses as much as of equations.
