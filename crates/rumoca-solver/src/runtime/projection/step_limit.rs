//! Per-iteration bound on a Newton step taken by the algebraic projection.
//!
//! A trust region on the Newton step, expressed here as a per-unknown relative
//! bound rather than a norm ball, is the globalization strategy of J. E. Dennis
//! Jr. and R. B. Schnabel, "Numerical Methods for Unconstrained Optimization
//! and Nonlinear Equations", SIAM 1996, chapter 6; section 6.3 is the
//! line-search counterpart the projection also uses, and section 7.2 is why the
//! bound is relative to each unknown's own magnitude.

/// Per-iteration bound on how far one unknown may move, as a fraction of its own
/// magnitude, in the branch-preserving algebraic projection.
///
/// A block whose rows contain a steeply curved constitutive law (the soft-magnetic
/// `mu_r(B)` of `Modelica.Magnetic.FluxTubes` is the reference case: relative
/// permeability falls by an order of magnitude across the saturation knee) has a
/// Newton direction whose linear extrapolation lands far outside the branch it was
/// taken on. The residual *decreases* there — the row is scaled by its own steep
/// derivative, so a large error in the row's target reads small — and the damped
/// Newton then walks a non-physical branch (`mu_r < 0`, hence a negative reluctance)
/// until it stalls. Capping every per-iteration movement makes the projection
/// follow the continuation branch instead of jumping to another converged root.
///
/// Provenance: the stall is *latent and pre-existing*, not a regression of any one
/// commit. The same block, the same guess and the same stall reproduce at the parent
/// of the commit whose certification run first reported it, and on every build once
/// the output grid is fine enough.
///
/// What changed was only whether the stall is reached, and that is a semantic
/// correction, not nondeterminism. `time_event_instant`
/// (`rumoca-phase-dae/src/construction/analysis/expression_events.rs`) now refuses an
/// `instant <= 0.0`, leaving a start-instant time relation to its zero crossing per
/// MLS §8.5 — an event is the instant an event generating expression *changes* value,
/// and initialization has already fixed that one. `Modelica.Blocks.Sources.Sine`
/// reaches this through `if time < startTime` with `startTime = 0`, so the example
/// that surfaced this used to get a scheduled stop at `t = 0` and now does not. That
/// stop was restarting the integrator, and the restart incidentally kept the warm
/// starts close enough for the unlimited Newton to survive. Removing it is correct;
/// the projection's inability to recover from a distant warm start is the defect, and
/// it is what this bound fixes.
///
/// The fraction is a globalization constant, and the root the projection converges to does
/// not depend on it: sweeping 0.01 to 0.9 reaches the same solution and changes only
/// the evaluation count.
