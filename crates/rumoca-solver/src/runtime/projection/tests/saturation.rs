/// The `Modelica.Magnetic.FluxTubes` saturating-reluctance block of
/// `Examples.BasicExamples.SaturatedInductor`, reduced to the five unknowns that
/// carry its nonlinearity.
///
/// `BaseClasses.FixedShape` (MSL 4.1.0) writes the iron path as
/// `B_N = |B/B_myMax|`,
/// `mu_r = 1 + (mu_i - 1 + c_a*B_N)/(1 + c_b*B_N + B_N^n)`,
/// `R_m = 1/G_m`, `V_m = Phi*R_m`, `B = Phi/A`, with `G_m = mu_0*mu_r*A/l` from
/// `Shapes.FixedShape.Cuboid`. The example puts a constant leakage reluctance and a
/// parasitic air gap around it, so the flux the coil carries splits between the two
/// branches. Coefficients are `Material.SoftMagnetic.ElectricSheet.M350_50A`;
/// geometry is the example's core.
///
/// Two properties of this block defeat an unlimited damped Newton together. Past the
/// permeability peak (`B_N > 1`) `mu_r` falls by an order of magnitude over a tenth
/// of a tesla, so the tangent extrapolates it through zero into a negative — and
/// physically impossible — relative permeability. And `R_m = 1/G_m` has a Jacobian
/// entry of `1/G_m^2 ~ 1e11`, which scales that row so hard that a reluctance wrong
/// by `1e8` still reads as a small residual. The step that leaves the branch
/// therefore *lowers* the scaled residual, and the line search takes it.
