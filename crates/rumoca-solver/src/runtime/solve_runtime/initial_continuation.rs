//! Certified coverage for the initialization homotopy continuation.
//!
//! `SolveLayout::initial_homotopy_parameter_index` allocates a hidden `P` slot
//! (λ) for models whose DAE carries `homotopy(actual, simplified)` (MLS 3.6
//! §3.7.4.3). λ is seeded to `1.0`, so every evaluation outside the
//! initialization continuation reads exactly `actual` — the trivial
//! implementation §3.7.4.3 sanctions. The continuation is the only thing that
//! ever moves λ: it walks λ from `0` to `1` **around the solves whose rows read
//! λ**, so the sweep can steer those unknowns off the simplified branch onto the
//! actual one, and restores `1.0` when it is done.
//!
//! That promise is only real if the driver and the checked artifact agree on
//! which solves the sweep governs. [`InitialContinuationCoverage`] is the single
//! place that answer lives: it is built from the two plans the driver re-solves
//! at every continuation value and it is what
//! `SolveRuntime::project_initial_variables` consults to decide what to
//! re-solve. A runtime that stops driving one of those solves must drop it from
//! the coverage, and models that need it are then rejected instead of silently
//! simulating whichever root a cold guess lands on (as observed on
//! `Modelica.Electrical.Analog.Examples.OpAmps.SignalGenerator`, which collapsed
//! to the trivial all-zero root because the sweep steered nothing at all).
//!
//! # One index space: the equation index
//!
//! Everything in this module is stated in **equation index** space — the row
//! index of the residual vector a system evaluates. Every value that arrives in
//! another space is translated explicitly, once, at its point of entry:
//!
//! * A [`solve::ScalarProgramBlock`] numbers its *programs* densely, but each
//!   stored output carries its own identity in `output_indices`. Program index
//!   and equation index coincide only for blocks built by
//!   `ScalarProgramBlock::with_program_spans`, which is why the unit fixtures
//!   below use real permutations: `BistableLoop` emits `[2, 1]`, `E10_Mixed`
//!   `[4, 1, 2, 3]`, `E11_Shifted` `[5, 4, 1, 2, 3]`. [`lambda_reading_equations`]
//!   is the only place a program index is turned into an equation index.
//! * `continuous.implicit_row_targets` and `initialization.row_targets()` are
//!   indexed by equation index.
//! * `InitializationProjectionBlock::rows` and `AlgebraicProjectionBlock::rows`
//!   are equation indices into the corresponding residual vector.
//! * [`AlgebraicRefreshRow::equation_index`] is an equation index;
//!   its opaque canonical scalar-program source is resolved only by the final
//!   evaluator adapter. Only `equation_index` is read here.
//!
//! [`AlgebraicRefreshRow::equation_index`]: rumoca_ir_solve::AlgebraicRefreshRow::equation_index
//!
//! # Acceptance contract (SPEC 0008 / SPEC 0036)
//!
//! Accepted:
//!
//! * No λ slot is allocated at all (the DAE carried no `homotopy`), in which
//!   case there is no continuation and no coverage object.
//! * λ is allocated and read by at least one lowered row of the model. Rows
//!   split into two groups:
//!   * **Steered** — `continuous.implicit_rhs` rows that target an algebraic
//!     slot, and `initialization.residual()` rows the initialization projection
//!     plan solves. The continuation drives these; this module proves a plan
//!     names each of them.
//!   * **Unsteered** — every other row family the lowering can put a λ read in:
//!     `continuous.derivative_rhs` (`der(y) = homotopy(...)`),
//!     `discrete.rhs` (`when c then z = homotopy(...); end when;`),
//!     `events.root_conditions`, `continuous.residual`,
//!     `continuous.manifold_residual`, `initialization.update_rhs()`,
//!     `visible_value_rows`, and `initialization.residual()` rows that no
//!     projection block solves (steady-state `initial equation der(x) = 0`
//!     against a `der(x) = homotopy(...)` equation). Nothing solves these rows
//!     for an unknown during the continuation, so they are evaluated at λ = 1,
//!     which is exactly `actual` — MLS §3.7.4.3's explicitly permitted trivial
//!     implementation `homotopy(actual, simplified) = actual`. They are legal
//!     and carry no coverage requirement.
//!
//! Rejected:
//!
//! * λ is allocated but **no** lowered row anywhere in the problem reads it: the
//!   `simplified` operand disappeared between DAE and Solve, which SPEC 0036
//!   forbids doing silently.
//! * λ is allocated outside the compiled parameter vector.
//! * A λ-reading `continuous.implicit_rhs` equation whose
//!   `implicit_row_targets` entry is an algebraic slot that no algebraic refresh
//!   plan names. The sweep would report success without ever having solved that
//!   row.
//!
//! Initialization row targets are derived from the same checked plan. The
//! former independent target/row mismatch is rejected during IR construction.
