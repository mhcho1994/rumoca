//! The internal FMI 3.0 Model Exchange contract (SPEC_0038 §Internal Solver
//! Boundary).
//!
//! `SolveProblem` stays compiler IR. It is projected exactly once, by
//! [`SolveMeKernel`], into an FMI 3 ME component kernel. Every integrator
//! reaches the model only through [`SolveMeKernel`]. Integrators MUST NOT inspect Solve rows,
//! layouts, opcodes, events, or private runtime objects.
//!
//! # Operation map
//!
//! The standard operations below map to FMI 3.0 ME entry points. Remaining
//! non-standard operations are concrete host/kernel composition points rather
//! than a one-implementation public trait.
//!
//! | Kernel operation | FMI 3.0 ME |
//! |---|---|
//! | `SolveMeKernel::instantiate` | `fmi3InstantiateModelExchange` |
//! | `SolveMeKernel::model_description` | model description + `fmi3GetNumberOfContinuousStates` / `fmi3GetNumberOfEventIndicators` |
//! | `SolveMeKernel::enter_configuration_mode` | `fmi3EnterConfigurationMode` |
//! | `SolveMeKernel::exit_configuration_mode` | `fmi3ExitConfigurationMode` |
//! | `SolveMeKernel::enter_initialization_mode` | `fmi3EnterInitializationMode` |
//! | `SolveMeKernel::exit_initialization_mode` | `fmi3ExitInitializationMode` |
//! | `SolveMeKernel::enter_event_mode` | `fmi3EnterEventMode` |
//! | `SolveMeKernel::update_discrete_states` | `fmi3UpdateDiscreteStates` |
//! | `SolveMeKernel::enter_continuous_time_mode` | `fmi3EnterContinuousTimeMode` |
//! | `SolveMeKernel::set_time` | `fmi3SetTime` |
//! | `SolveMeKernel::set_continuous_states` | `fmi3SetContinuousStates` |
//! | `SolveMeKernel::get_continuous_states` | `fmi3GetContinuousStates` |
//! | `SolveMeKernel::get_nominals_of_continuous_states` | `fmi3GetNominalsOfContinuousStates` |
//! | `SolveMeKernel::get_continuous_state_derivatives` | `fmi3GetContinuousStateDerivatives` |
//! | `SolveMeKernel::get_directional_derivative` | `fmi3GetDirectionalDerivative` |
//! | `SolveMeKernel::get_event_indicators` | `fmi3GetEventIndicators` |
//! | `SolveMeKernel::get_outputs` | batched `fmi3GetFloat64` |
//! | `SolveMeKernel::value_reference` / `SolveMeKernel::set_float64` | model description + batched `fmi3SetFloat64` |
//! | `SolveMeKernel::fmu_state` / `SolveMeKernel::reset_to_fmu_state` | `fmi3GetFMUState` / `fmi3Reset` + `fmi3SetFMUState` |
//! | `SolveMeKernel::terminate` | `fmi3Terminate` |
//!
//! ## Non-standard operations scheduled for removal from this surface
//!
//! - `SolveMeKernel::project_continuous_states`: FMI 3.0 forbids the
//!   FMU from changing continuous states in Continuous-Time Mode. Rumoca's
//!   index-reduced DAEs carry a constraint manifold the accepted point must be
//!   projected onto. The operation is separate from
//!   `completed_integrator_step` so the host sees the state change explicitly.
//! - [`MeTime::event_boundary`]: FMI 3.0 §3 (Model Exchange) requires the
//!   integrator not to step across a known event instant; rumoca additionally
//!   needs the FMU to evaluate the *left limit* of that instant, so the
//!   boundary travels with `fmi3SetTime`.
//! - [`MeEventEntry`]: `fmi3EnterEventMode` takes no arguments in FMI 3.0.
//!   Rumoca's component needs the event `cause` (state event versus its own
//!   scheduled instant), the `event_time` the host located, and the `horizon`
//!   it will not integrate past before its next output point, because the
//!   component clamps its right-limit evaluation to that horizon.
//! - `SolveMeKernel::observe`: a refresh of the component's observable
//!   (algebraic) vector at the current time, returning that observation point.
//!   It is *not* `fmi3GetFMUState`: it snapshots no discrete state and cannot
//!   be restored. Only `SolveMeKernel::fmu_state` and
//!   `SolveMeKernel::reset_to_fmu_state` map to the FMU-state calls.
//! - [`MeStage`]: FMI 3.0 reports one undifferentiated `fmi3Error`. rumoca's
//!   MSL harness buckets every failure by the sub-stage that raised it, so the
//!   component mints that stage where the failure happens rather than letting a
//!   host re-derive it from rendered text.
