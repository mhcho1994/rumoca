//! The checked numerical-plugin contract (SPEC_0044 §6, ME-INT-001/002).
//!
//! A numerical plugin owns exactly one thing: advancing the continuous state by
//! one accepted internal step and sampling that step's native continuous
//! extension. Everything else — FMI lifecycle transitions, Event Mode, root
//! meaning, output scheduling, trace roles, component policy — belongs to
//! [`super::session::MeSimulationSession`].
//!
//! The aggregates below have private fields and checked constructors, so an
//! invalid boundary value can never enter the master algorithm.
//!
//! # Provenance
//!
//! A plugin never returns, and never can name, anything that claims host
//! provenance. Its advance returns a [`MeStepCandidate`]: raw numbers, with no
//! request, no previous point, no component width, and no checked coordinate.
//! The host lends the actual [`MeAdvanceRequest`] for that one call and then
//! **consumes** it into the host-private `MeStepProposal` while checking the
//! candidate against it, so the proposal holds the request's own coordinates by
//! construction and the accepted proof holds the proposal. Forging a foreign
//! request, replaying an earlier one, crossing a bound, and asserting a
//! component width are therefore all unrepresentable rather than merely
//! rejected, and no token, identifier, or second correlation fact exists to be
//! guessed or compared.
