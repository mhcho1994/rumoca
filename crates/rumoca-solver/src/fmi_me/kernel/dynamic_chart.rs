//! Runtime state selection over the issued reduced charts of a folding group
//! (SPEC_0053 section 2a; SPEC_0040 STRUCT-T07 constraint-fold chart rows).
//!
//! A fixed reduced basis folds where the slope of a reconstructed coordinate
//! vanishes on the manifold: the gradient `2*x_i` of a conserved norm, or the
//! Cardan factor of a loop closure. The compiler issues a bounded set of
//! alternate charts on the continuous solve system, each carrying its complete
//! executable image in the same solver-Y space as the primary basis: the
//! mirrors of a first-integral group, or the single exchanges of a reduced
//! constraint group. This module builds one runtime per chart, precomputes each
//! chart's slope geometry, and decides at an accepted step whether to switch.
//!
//! Every model without such a group carries an empty chart set, so
//! [`build_reduced_charts`] returns `None` and the component behaves exactly as
//! it did before dynamic state selection existed.
