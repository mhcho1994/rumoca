//! The committed algebraic seed of a continuous-time refresh (SPEC_0044
//! ME-PROJ-005), the warm-start rule of an importer-driven instance
//! (Solve IR `RefreshSeedRule::CommittedAcceptedPoint`; an integrator-driven
//! run keeps its integrator's warm start).
//!
//! An importer-driven refresh starts its Newton solves from the committed
//! seed, never from the importer's last trial evaluation, so its result is a
//! function of (t, x, p, relation memory, committed seed). The seed is the
//! settled coordinate at the last event exit or, after a completed integrator
//! step, the derivative refresh at the accepted point from the previous seed.
//! That refresh runs once, on the first refresh after the step, and a
//! derivative query at the accepted point reads its result. Event Mode keeps
//! its own iteration's warm start. `fmi3/me_projection.jinja`
//! `committed_seed` renders the same rule.
