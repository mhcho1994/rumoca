//! The retained opaque derivative handle and its host-private activation
//! controller (SPEC_0044 §6, ME-INT-001/002).
//!
//! A persistent implicit method cannot store a capability lent for the duration
//! of one call, and rebuilding its problem on every accepted step would discard
//! exactly the order and difference history SPEC_0044 §7 requires evidence
//! against. The contract is therefore one *retained* handle whose reachability
//! is governed by a host-owned activation state rather than by a Rust lifetime.
//!
//! [`MeDerivativeHandle`] is the whole plugin-visible surface: one opaque,
//! non-`Clone` value naming no kernel, no Solve root, no FMI lifecycle
//! transition, no event/root/trace policy, and no concrete solver. A plugin may
//! store it inside a persistent numerical problem. It may evaluate through it
//! only while the host is executing `initialize`, exactly one `advance`, or
//! `truncate_reset`; during `sample` and outside every host call the capability
//! is inactive and every request is a typed contract failure.
//!
//! [`MeDerivativeController`] is the other half and never leaves the common
//! host. It owns activation, issues one handle per `initialize`, and reads the
//! latched failure. The shared cell behind both is an implementation detail: no
//! public API names it, and no public API hands out an `Rc`.
