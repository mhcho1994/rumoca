# VS Code Extension

The **Rumoca Modelica** extension provides language support (diagnostics,
completion, hover, semantic highlighting), simulation commands, scenario
settings, and result viewers — all inside VS Code.

Install it from the
[marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JamesGoppert.rumoca-modelica).
It bundles a `rumoca-lsp` language server, so no separate install is needed.
To use your own server build instead (for compiler development), enable
`rumoca.useSystemServer` and put `rumoca-lsp` on `PATH`.

## Modelica Source Roots

Modelica package paths for a workspace are configured with
`rumoca-workspace.toml`.

Place the file at the workspace root, or in a subdirectory when the roots only
apply below that directory:

```toml
source_roots = [
  "../target/msl/ModelicaStandardLibrary-4.1.0",
  "../target/cmm/CMM-a642c381",
]
```

The Rumoca repository examples include `examples/rumoca-workspace.toml`. Run
`cargo xtask repo modelica-deps ensure` first so those target directories exist.

## Settings Panel

Open Rumoca settings from the toolbar or command palette
(**Open Rumoca Settings**). Shared package roots belong in
`rumoca-workspace.toml`; **Scenario Source Root Paths** edits the active
`rumoca-scenario.toml` for paths that only apply to that one configured run.

The picker stores workspace-relative paths whenever the selected folder is
inside the workspace.

## Inlay Hints

Array-dimension hints (for example `[2x3]` after a component name) are always
shown. Parameter-name hints, which label call arguments with the callee's
parameter names, are controlled by `rumoca.inlayHints.parameterNames` and are
off by default. Set it to one of:

- `none` (default): no parameter-name hints.
- `userFunctions`: hints only for calls to user-defined functions, using each
  function's declared parameter names.
- `all`: hints for user-defined functions and for known builtin functions.

Single-argument calls (such as `der(x)`) never receive a parameter-name hint,
and each hint is anchored at the start of the full argument, including any
leading unary operator. Changing the setting takes effect after the language
server restarts.

## Running Models

Run actions operate on `rumoca-scenario.toml` scenario files. The extension contributes
`rumoca-scenario.toml` as a TOML language extension, so normal TOML editor features
attach while Rumoca still activates for `rumoca-scenario.toml` and `.mo` files. Use
**Create Rumoca Scenario** to generate a `rumoca-scenario.toml` for a model; the
runnable source of truth is always the scenario file.

For interactive examples, open the `rumoca-scenario.toml` scenario, then use Play. For
batch simulation, the results panel opens inside VS Code.

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Create Rumoca Scenario | Generate a `rumoca-scenario.toml` next to a model |
| Run Current Rumoca Scenario | Compile and simulate the active scenario |
| Open Scenario Settings | Edit the active scenario's settings |
| Open Rumoca Settings | Extension settings menu |
| Open Rumoca User Guide | This book |
| Open Rumoca Dev Guide | The contributor book |
| Toggle / Expand All / Collapse All Annotation Expansion | Control inline annotation rendering |

## Diagnostics

Compiler and simulation diagnostics are reported to the Problems panel when
a source span is available. CLI output uses rich terminal diagnostics; VS
Code diagnostics use the raw file/range information without terminal
wrappers.

Compile and instantiate errors appear in the Problems panel as well, not only
in the compile-status lens above a model. When a model fails its full compile
because a component's class cannot be instantiated, the error is anchored at
the enclosing model or class name in your open document, and the originating
library location is included in the diagnostic message so the detail is not
lost. This means the failure you would otherwise see only when simulating is
now visible as a squiggle while you edit.

## Documentation Access

The user guide and the contributor guide are available directly from the
command palette (**Open Rumoca User Guide** / **Open Rumoca Dev Guide
Guide**), so you do not need to hunt for URLs. The same live-example pages
work in any browser.
