# Contributing to Rumoca

Contributions are welcome.

## Setup

Install the `xtask` developer CLI launcher once:

```bash
cargo xtask repo cli install
```

That installs the `xtask` launcher, installs shell completions for the detected shell, and uses your cargo bin directory, usually `~/.cargo/bin`.
If that directory is not already on `PATH`, `xtask` will print shell-specific fixups.

If you want `xtask` to write the persistent PATH update for you:

```bash
cargo xtask repo cli install --path
```

Then install the repo hooks:

```bash
cargo xtask repo hooks install
```

## Command Layout

The canonical top-level command groups are:

- `cargo xtask verify full` for the full local/CI verification suite
- `cargo xtask verify quick` for lint, MSL parity, the pinned corpus, architecture gates, and workspace tests
- `cargo xtask verify ...` for local and CI verification gates
- `cargo xtask vscode ...` for VS Code extension workflows
- `cargo xtask playground ...` for browser playground workflows
- `cargo xtask python ...` for Python binding workflows
- `cargo xtask coverage ...` for coverage generation, reporting, and gating
- `cargo xtask repo ...` for hooks, completions, releases, graphs, policy helpers, and MSL reference-data maintenance

## Local Prerequisites

Rust-only workflows do not require Node/npm:

```bash
cargo build
cargo check
cargo test
cargo xtask --help
```

Nix is only a convenience wrapper: all canonical build and verification logic
remains in Cargo/xtask and works with equivalent Rust, native, and task-specific
packages installed through the host system. If you choose Nix, the default
`nix develop` shell contains only the pinned Rust and native build toolchain; it
does not build Rumoca. Select optional tools with a named shell:

```bash
nix develop .#wasm      # Node, Binaryen, wasm-pack
nix develop .#python    # Python, JAX/CasADi, maturin
nix develop .#julia     # Julia (Linux)
nix develop .#modelica  # OpenModelica (Linux)
nix develop .#fmi       # FMI validation/template tools
nix develop .#docs      # mdBook and docs WASM tools
nix develop .#full      # all optional development tools
```

Use `cargo run -p rumoca -- ...` while developing the compiler. Building the
store-native package remains an explicit `nix build .#rumoca` operation.

Package, playground, VS Code, and browser-asset workflows do require Node/npm.
CI uses Node 20, so local package validation should use Node 20 as well:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

Commands that may install npm dependencies or run npm package builds include:

```bash
cargo xtask web build
cargo xtask playground test
cargo xtask vscode build
cargo xtask vscode package --target linux-x64
```

Cargo builds must remain Rust-only. If a selected package/web command reports a
missing `node` or `npm`, install Node 20 using your platform package manager,
Volta, nvm, or the official Node installer, then retry that command.

### Kani bounded verification

The SPEC_0037 verification track carries its bounded-verification harnesses in
`rumoca-solver`. Each property is written once as a plain function with two
drivers: `#[cfg(kani)]` proof harnesses and, under `#[cfg(not(kani))]`, a
`proptest` fallback stating the identical property.

The official Linux flake pins Kani 0.67.0 and its matching Rust nightly in a
dedicated shell, leaving the ordinary development toolchain unchanged. Run the
required proof set with:

```bash
nix develop .#kani --command cargo xtask verify kani
```

The command rejects any other Kani version and drives the solver harnesses from
the checked-in `infra/verification/kani-proofs.json` manifest. Add a harness to that
manifest in the same change that makes it required; every entry MUST declare its
production kernel, symbolic inputs, enumeration barrier, counterexample meaning,
bounds, and a non-empty `assumptions` list (SPEC_0037) — the gate rejects
entries without one. GitHub CI runs this exact
gate with a bounded Linux job and uploads the versioned, per-harness result at
`target/verification/kani-summary.json`.

The gate verifies one Kani harness at a time as required by SPEC_0037. Cargo's
build jobs still use the repository's normal host-aware resource budget.

Ordinary `cargo test -p rumoca-solver` still runs the `proptest` fallbacks. A
green fallback is validation evidence, never proof evidence; only a successful
`cargo xtask verify kani` run under the pinned verifier is Kani proof evidence.

## Common Commands

Typical local verification:

```bash
cargo xtask verify full
cargo xtask verify lint
cargo xtask verify workspace
cargo xtask verify quick
cargo xtask verify template-runtimes
```

`cargo xtask verify quick` runs lint, full MSL parity, the pinned real-model
corpus, architecture gates, and workspace tests. `cargo xtask verify full`
also runs examples, binary builds, template runtimes, coverage, documentation,
VS Code, and browser/WASM gates. The full suite expects the same local
prerequisites that CI installs: `cargo-llvm-cov`, Node 20/npm for package/web
tasks, and the wasm Rust target/tooling. Both suites require the external
model libraries used by their corpus gates.
`cargo xtask verify template-runtimes` wraps
Cargo-native opt-in example-template execution checks such as
`cargo test -p rumoca --features template-runtime-tests --test suite_template_runtime backend_template_runtime_regression:: -- --nocapture`.

Pre-landing gate over a committed snapshot:

```bash
cargo xtask verify gate --rev <commit> --coverage
cargo xtask verify gate --worktree ../my-worktree --crates rumoca-solver xtask
```

`verify gate` extracts `git archive` of the revision (or of a worktree's
committed `HEAD`; uncommitted changes are not part of it) into
`<temp>/rumoca-gate/<rev>/snap` with its own Cargo target directory, links
`target/msl` and `target/fmi-conformance` from the repository, and runs CI's
blocking steps in order: `cargo fmt --check`, workspace clippy (without
`rumoca-phase-instantiate`), `verify lint`, the unit tests of the changed
crates (default: crates changed relative to upstream `main`; `--crates`
overrides), `suite_core`, the `rumoca/msl-sim-tests` regressions, the
architecture and `suite_gates` tests (`commit_messages` is skipped, since a
snapshot has no history), rustdoc of the changed crates with warnings denied,
and the template runtime tests. The CasADi and JAX template targets need
Python packages a local shell may lack, so their failures are reported but
do not fail the gate. `--coverage` adds the coverage run, report, and trim gate
with CI's allowances (it needs `cargo-llvm-cov`). The run stops at the first
failing step and prints `GATE_OK <rev> (<log>)` or `GATE_FAILED <rev> (<log>)`
with the failing step; the target directory is removed after a pass unless
`--keep` is given. The tools (FMPy, CMake, Java, `xmllint`) are taken from the
current `PATH`.

MSL parity sweeps on a shared host:

```bash
cargo xtask verify msl-parity --serialize --rerun-timeouts-alone 90 --results-dir target/msl/sweep
cargo xtask verify msl-parity diff target/msl/sweep/merged_band_table.json reference_band_table.json
```

`--serialize` holds a host-wide lock (`<temp>/rumoca-msl-parity.lock`) for the
whole run, so two sweeps never overlap on one machine. `--rerun-timeouts-alone
<secs>` reruns, after the sweep, every model that missed `high` because a wall
budget ran out, one model at a time with the given solver and per-phase
budgets, into `<results>/rerun/<model>`, and writes
`<results>/merged_band_table.json` with each rerun row replacing its sweep row.
`msl-parity diff <table> <reference>` prints the strict-high count (`high` with
no channel deviation) of both tables and the rows lost, gained, or otherwise
changed.

Watching CI after a landing (read-only; it never pushes):

```bash
cargo xtask ci watch <sha>
```

`ci watch` finds the runs of the commit on `main` through the `gh` CLI, waits
until they complete (`--interval-secs`, or `--once` to report the current
state), and prints each run's conclusion and the jobs that failed.

Editor validation:

```bash
cargo xtask vscode test
cargo xtask playground test
```

Extension packaging:

```bash
cargo xtask vscode build
cargo xtask vscode package --target linux-x64
```

MSL/reference maintenance:

```bash
cargo xtask verify msl-parity
cargo xtask repo msl omc-reference
cargo xtask repo msl flamegraph --model Modelica.Electrical.Digital.Examples.DFFREG --mode compile
cargo xtask repo msl promote-quality-baseline
```

Verification-surface classification:

- `cargo xtask verify workspace` includes the two required
  `rumoca/msl-sim-tests` MSL simulation regressions. It needs the pinned MSL
  tree at `target/msl/ModelicaStandardLibrary-4.1.0`, which the CI workspace
  job stages before running.
- `backend-stress-tests` is an opt-in 30-model diagnostic survey, not a
  correctness gate: it reports per-model failures and only requires one
  end-to-end comparison for each selected backend.
- `msl-external-tests` contains opt-in MSL corpus cross-checks for generated
  backends. Nightly CI surveys the checked C Solve and CasADi targets under the
  Nix development shell. FMI 2/3 packaging is intentionally absent until it is
  rebuilt against the checked kernel. `fmu_target_discovery` is a manual
  target-list maintenance workflow, not a pass/fail verification gate.

```bash
nix develop .#full --command cargo test --release -p rumoca-test-msl \
  --features backend-stress-tests --test backend_stress_test -- --nocapture
nix develop .#default --command cargo test --release -p rumoca-test-msl \
  --features msl-external-tests --test c_ode_msl_test -- --nocapture
```

Command discovery:

```bash
cargo xtask help
cargo xtask help verify
cargo xtask help repo msl
cargo xtask help repo cli install
```

## Parser Grammar Regeneration

The Modelica parser is generated from
`crates/rumoca-phase-parse/src/modelica.par`, and the GALEC parser is generated
from `crates/rumoca-phase-parse-galec/src/parse/galec.par`, by their phase-crate
build scripts. Generated Rust files are checked in beside each grammar so
parser changes are reviewable.

When changing the grammar or parser generator settings, regenerate and test
with:

```bash
cargo check -p rumoca-phase-parse
cargo test -p rumoca-phase-parse --test recovery_corpus --quiet
cargo check -p rumoca-phase-parse-galec
cargo test -p rumoca-phase-parse-galec --quiet
git diff -- crates/rumoca-phase-parse/src/generated
git diff -- crates/rumoca-phase-parse-galec/src/parse/generated
```

The workspace pins `parol` and `parol_runtime` to exact patch versions in
`Cargo.toml`. Do not loosen those pins with a grammar change; update the pin
intentionally and review the generated diff in the same change.

## Process

For compiler-affecting changes, follow:

- `spec/SPEC_0025_PR_REVIEW_PROCESS.md`
- `spec/README.md`

Project specifications live under [`spec/`](spec/).

## Practical Expectations

- Run the smallest verification gate that actually covers your change.
- Prefer `cargo xtask` commands over ad hoc local scripts so local and CI workflows stay aligned.
- Keep contributor-facing command examples in docs synchronized with the actual CLI.
- Include a PR size budget in the pull-request body:
  - production lines added/deleted,
  - test lines added/deleted,
  - net lines and file count,
  - public API item delta.
- If the PR has positive net lines, include a short cleanup/compression pass plan
  and explicit rationale for every new abstraction.
