# Diffsol numerical corrections

This directory contains the published `diffsol` 0.13.2 crate, with source
changes confined to `src/ode_solver/bdf.rs` and
`src/nonlinear_solver/line_search.rs`. Original authorship and licensing are
preserved in the upstream sources and `LICENSE.txt` (copied from the same
upstream commit because the published crate omits the repository license file).

After Newton convergence, Diffsol updates its backward differences using the
accepted correction, but copies the uncorrected predictor into `state.y`.
Consequently, the accepted state and the continuous extension disagree at the
same time. Periodic resets discard the correction when they restart from that
published state. The patch publishes column zero of the updated backward
differences, the corrected accepted solution used by interpolation.

The direct dependency regression is
`rumoca-solver-diffsol/src/me_integrator/tests.rs::native_bdf_endpoint_matches_its_continuous_extension`.
The source-level regression is
`rumoca/tests/suite_core/sampled_integral_consistency.rs`, which checks
`pre(x)` against the continuous event-entry integral before `reinit(x,0)`.
It fails with the registry dependency on BDF and passes on the RK host.

The second correction applies the configured minimum step before each new BDF
attempt, then reapplies any closer hard stop. The initial-step heuristic can
choose a smaller step for a tiny nonzero state; a hard stop can also shorten a
step below that minimum. Previously BDF accepted such steps and subsequently
raised `StepSizeTooSmall` while increasing the step after successful solves.
The error-driven reduction check is unchanged. Difference-table rescaling
uses the actual new step size, including the exact configured minimum.

Three direct dependency regressions cover tiny initial states, continuation
after a short hard stop (both forward and backward), and preservation of the
minimum-step failure for unresolved dynamics. The originating MSL execution
failure is `RectifierBridge2mPulse.HalfControlledBridge2mPulse`; it remains
subject to its existing comparator exclusion and is not a parity claim.
Upstream commit `a33f02a4952c6837979754cab92eef70763a2f41` was inspected during
triage and retains the original initial-step/minimum-step interaction.

The third correction makes backtracking Newton consume correction-norm history
through the same convergence interface as full-step Newton. The original path
never populated the history used for its contraction estimate. It reevaluated
already converged affine problems and failed to reject rates that could not
meet its iteration budget. Upstream commit
`7036380f908dbd93baa4253d2e0a34aa115cbbb5` retains that behavior in
`crates/diffsol-nl/src/line_search.rs`.

History alone is insufficient: the line search computes the next Newton
correction at its accepted trial point, but has not applied that correction.
The patch carries that pending correction to the next outer iteration, records
its norm once, and applies it before returning a convergence certificate for
the remaining error. Armijo conditions, tolerances, Jacobian/timestep estimate
resets, and the iteration budget are unchanged. Rejected line-search trials do
not advance convergence history.

Four direct dependency regressions in
`rumoca-solver-diffsol/src/me_integrator/convergence_tests.rs` cover affine solve
reuse, early rejection of inadequate contraction, retained backtracking, and
accuracy against a manufactured nonlinear root. A history-only negative control
returns `0.0098039` for an exact root of zero when its requested nonlinear bound
is `0.0002`; the corrected iteration applies the pending correction and meets
that bound with two residual evaluations instead of four.

The fourth correction scopes the nonlinear-failure budget to one attempted
accepted step, as the existing error-test budget already does. Lifetime
statistics remain cumulative. With measured Newton contraction enabled,
`OvervoltageProtection` stopped after 804 successful steps because 51 recovered
failures had accumulated across 50 distinct steps; no individual step had more
than two failures. The configured limit of 50 is unchanged. The direct
dependency tests in `me_integrator/failure_budget_tests.rs` require accurate
continued integration after earlier recoveries and retain rejection of a step
with persistent failures. Upstream commit
`7036380f908dbd93baa4253d2e0a34aa115cbbb5` retains the cumulative-limit check in
`crates/diffsol/src/ode_solver/bdf.rs`. A per-step convergence-failure budget is
also the documented [CVODE recovery contract](https://sundials.readthedocs.io/en/v7.5.0/cvode/Usage/).

The workspace patch makes local, CI, native, and Wasm builds use the same
corrected source. A registry-published Rumoca crate cannot rely on a workspace
`[patch]`: registry publication still requires an upstream release containing
these fixes, or publication of an explicitly maintained patched dependency.
These patches have not been submitted upstream. Replace this directory with a
released dependency only after all direct numerical and source-level
regressions pass against that release and the complete MSL comparison passes.
